  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It takes no extended examination of any period in the
last fifty years—the term covered by the phrase “Our
Times” in the title of this book—to convince an unprejudiced
student that as far as the tariff is concerned public
opinion has never been fairly embodied in the bills adopted.
If the popular understanding of protection as expressed in
our elections had been conscientiously followed, there would
be to-day no duties on iron and steel products, on cheap
cottons and cotton mixtures, and, certainly none on a great
variety of raw materials probably including raw wool. That
is, in these cases and in multitudes of similar ones, the
purposes of protection had been realized, or it had been
proved that they never could be realized; and in either case
the dogma required the duty to be withdrawn. This volume
is an attempt to tell in narrative form the story of this
defeat of the popular will.</p>

<p class='c007'>The major part of the material in the volume has appeared
at intervals in the last five years in the <cite>American Magazine</cite>.
So many persons concerned in the making of our tariffs in
the period covered have aided me directly or indirectly
by documents, personal reminiscences, and explanations of
points of view that I find it out of the question to attempt
to enumerate them. In one case, however, my debt is so
great that I must acknowledge it specifically, and that is
to Mr. Horace White, who has read, either in manuscript
or proofs, the bulk of this volume and who has been generous
in his suggestions and criticisms.</p>

<p class='c006'>If there was any public question on which the minds of
the people of the United States were made up fifty years
ago, it was that of the tariff. They had not been made up
in a day. On the contrary, it had taken nearly seventy
years of experimenting to bring them where they were—seventy
years in which all forms of taxation on imported
goods had been tried, from the supposed 8½ per cent of
the first Congress to the 43 per cent of the “tariff of abominations”
in 1828. Some of their experiments had been
good and some bad, but out of them all they had struck a
mean which was something like this: As a nation we intend
to raise money to carry on our business by putting a
duty on certain raw and manufactured goods brought from
foreign countries. If we find we are getting too large a
revenue we will cut down the duty, if too small we will
raise it. In placing these duties we will do as Alexander
Hamilton advised—that is, if there is a young industry in
the country trying to produce something which is <i>essential</i>
to war or on which our daily living depends, we will protect
it from foreign competition until it is established—<i>but no
longer</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>For ten years the country had been working on this tariff
platform, and so satisfied were they with it that when they
found in 1857 they were taking in more money than they
needed for expenses, they promptly passed a bill cutting the
duties down to an average of 20 per cent—the lowest they
had been since 1816. The duty on many articles they removed
entirely—thus, cheap raw wool was allowed to come
in free. Nobody, except the Pennsylvanians, and a few New
Englanders, objected strongly to the bill; even the majority
of manufacturers and old Henry Clay tariff men agreed.
Henry Clay had told them that protective duties were never
meant to be perpetual, and they looked upon this lowering
of taxes as a natural step in the process of gradual extinction
which they had been taught to expect.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not only was the mind of the country satisfied with lower
duties and an increasing list of free goods, but it had accepted
the idea that a Christian nation should establish as
rapidly as possible reciprocal trade relations with its neighbors.
For three years a reciprocity treaty between ourselves
and Canada had been working. It was not as good a
treaty as might be, and the Canadians were getting greater
advantages from it than we; but it could be improved, and
there was much pride in the country over the advance it
was felt this treaty showed in national broad-mindedness
and generosity.</p>

<p class='c007'>That was fifty years ago. To-day the average tax on
dutiable goods imported into the United States is nearer 50
per cent than 20. Instead of reciprocity with Canada we
have had for fifty years in many cases prohibitive protection.
Why is this? What has become of the theories and
practices of fifty years ago?</p>

<p class='c007'>The answer lies in a curious story—a story of a panic
and a war and the natural penalties which panics and wars
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>impose. The panic came first—in 1857, just after Congress
had lowered duties to prevent the collection of more money
than we needed for actual expenses. It was a logical enough
panic—panics always are logical. For several years the
country had been making money. It had lost its head over
its growing wealth—had speculated, had built railroads
faster than they were needed, had spent lavishly. Its expenses
finally outran its income and a crash naturally came.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tariff had nothing whatever to do with the disturbance,
but the effect of the panic on the national income was
soon evident; straitened for money the country bought less
abroad, buying less the revenue was less. In 1857 it had
been $64,000,000, but the year after it was but 42 millions,
and the year after that (1859) but 48 millions. Instead of
too much money, Congress saw itself with too little. Its
credit was sadly disturbed, not only or chiefly because of
this falling revenue, but because of the agitation of the
slavery question and the increasing contention between
North and South.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was natural enough, of course, that when the revenues
from imports continued to be too little to pay the government’s
bills, there should be a demand for higher duties.
This demand was headed by a member of the House of
Representatives from Vermont, Mr. Justin S. Morrill.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Morrill was an able and honest man, who had been
sent to Congress by the “Conscience Whigs” of his district—not
because he had sought the office, but purely because
they believed from what they had seen of him as a merchant
in their community, they could trust him to represent them
on the slavery question. Now, Mr. Morrill was one of the
Whigs who had not been satisfied to see duties lowered
in 1857, and who strenuously objected to letting in raw
products free of duty. He wanted all wool protected. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>wanted his Vermont marble protected. He wanted maple
sugar protected. He was one of the few New England representatives
who had spoken, as well as voted, against the bill
of 1857, and his speech at that time had been very able. Indeed
it made him the acknowledged head of the active protectionist
sentiment left in the country, for he made no bones
about declaring his faith. “Such articles of primary necessity,”
he said, “as there is any hope of successfully producing
should be waked into life, nursed into perennial vigor by
moderate and steady discrimination in their favor, so long
as their condition makes it proper, so long as there is a probable
chance of ultimate success.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Morrill saw the opportunity for reviving protection
in 1858 when the revenues were insufficient, and he determined
to prepare a new bill which should represent his views. But
the interest in the subject at that moment was so little that
he could not get a hearing from the House. The next session,
however, gave him a rare chance. In the fall of 1859 a Congress
largely Republican took its seat. After a fierce fight
this Congress elected a Republican speaker, and this speaker
put a young man destined to play a large part in National
finances at the head of the Ways and Means Committee—John
Sherman of Ohio. Mr. Sherman was just 37 years old,
and as shrewd, as active, and as experienced a politician as
the Republicans had in the House. He had begun his political
life when about 21 years old with but two political tenets—hatred
of the Democratic party and belief in protection of
American industries. Political conscience had been unstirred
within him until the repeal of the Missouri Compromise.
That turned him into a Crusader. Sherman had been fighting
solely against slavery extension for six years, when his appointment
to the head of the Ways and Means Committee
suddenly made it his duty to consider finances. At once his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>old faith in protection asserted itself, and he gave full support
to Mr. Morrill, who was instructed by the Committee of Ways
and Means to prepare a new tariff bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Morrill worked out his bill with great care and patience,
and when it came out of committee early in 1860 it represented
very nearly what he believed. Mr. Sherman, who
from this time on had much to do with tariff bills, says in
his autobiography that the Morrill Bill at the start was nearer
meeting the double requirement of revenue and protection
than any bill he was ever familiar with.</p>

<p class='c007'>But good as the bill may have been when it came from the
committee, it was soon assaulted right and left by those who
had something to protect or those who were affected by what
it protected. Much of the pressure, Mr. Morrill found,
was impossible to resist. What can you do when a Senator
of the United States, one so famous as Charles Sumner,
“calls your attention” to letting cocoa in free (though according
to the principle on which you are working it should
pay a slight duty) because his friend, the head of an “eminent
house” (the friend was Henry L. Pierce and the “eminent
house” was his chocolate factory), wants his cocoa free?
What are you to do when Pennsylvania iron men and Rhode
Island manufacturers, who according to your theory of protection
are established and whose duties should gradually be
lowered, come down on you for higher rates, and your party
colleagues tell you that if you refuse their requests the election
may be lost and the cause of human freedom be retarded?
Amendment after amendment was tacked on the bill, many
of them in direct contradiction of Mr. Morrill’s principles.
They destroyed the justice and the consistency of the measure,
and he became so disgusted that he was ready to abandon
it. Inconsistency was less troublesome to Mr. Sherman,
however. He was a “practical politician,” something Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Morrill never was. He believed more revenue to be necessary;
he believed in protection; he believed in winning votes
for the party wherever and however he could. This bill
contributed to all these ends, and he himself undertook to
engineer it through the House. Mr. Sherman’s task was
made the easier because in May, when the Republicans had
met in Chicago to nominate their candidate for president,
they had put into their platform a plank which pledged the
party to support protection, though they did not have the
courage to use the word. This plank was plainly a bid for
the vote of communities which could be held to the party only
by protection, preëminently the state of Pennsylvania. The
great leaders of the party, Mr. Lincoln, Mr. Chase, and Mr.
Seward, did not believe that the tariff should be taken up at
all at this time. Indeed, only a few days before he was
nominated as president Mr. Lincoln wrote to a correspondent
that “the tariff question ought not to be agitated in the
Chicago Convention.” Mr. Chase had always stood with
the Democrats on the matter, and Seward had expressed his
view in the Senate in 1857 when the tariff bill was up: “It
is not wise, it is not just, to draw from the pockets of the
people into the Treasury of the country an amount of money
greater than the current expenses of the Treasury require.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Morrill Bill passed the House in May, 1860, but the
Senate would have none of it. That body was still Democratic
and the South still led. Not only was the South
strongly free trade in its opinions, but at that moment no bill
originating with the Republicans had a ghost of a chance, such
was the bitterness of the feeling. The bill went over to the
next session, and the next session brought a tragic change
in the Senate. By the time Mr. Morrill’s bill had a hearing
six states had withdrawn from the Union, and their Senators
had left Washington. The withdrawal of the Southern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Senators left the control to the Republicans, and it soon
became evident that the bill would probably pass. The
result was a fierce onslaught by all sorts of interests. Almost
everybody got what he wanted. Some of the items which
went into the schedule were long subjects of mirth and scandal
to the opposition. Such was the protection of 20 per cent
accorded to wood-screws. At that time there was but one
small factory for wood-screws in the country. It was situated
in Providence, Rhode Island, and Senator Simmons, who
secured its protection, and who was popularly supposed to be
interested in the concern, was long known as “Wood-Screw”
Simmons. The bill also carried a generous basket clause into
which all raw materials and all manufactured articles “not
otherwise provided for” were dumped.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was little wonder that jobbery found an easy way into
the bill. The country was in an uproar over secession and in
a state of doubt and unrest about Mr. Lincoln—what would
he do? Was he the man for a crisis? A poor time indeed
to consider deliberately so serious a matter as new tariff
schedules! There was an imperative need of money and it
looked as if this bill would give it, so the Morrill Bill finally
went through, and 48 hours before his term ended President
Buchanan gave it his signature.</p>

<p class='c007'>The immediate effect of the Morrill Bill was something
quite unlooked for. The increased tariffs made Europe
deeply indignant. England and France were particularly
hard hit; for instance, the duties on cheap clothes, of which
they sent us great quantities, were largely raised. Besides
the growing free trade sentiment abroad, the sentiment of
the liberal party everywhere was shocked that the new Republican
party, which had arisen against human slavery,
should take the narrower view of commerce. To make the
matter worse for the Republicans, the seceders, in session at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Montgomery, adopted a tariff for revenue only. Thus,
before Sumter was fired on, Europe had turned to the Confederacy
as the more liberal in commercial policy. It is
probable that if the Morrill Bill had been simply a revenue
measure the cause of the North would have met a very different
reception in Europe from what it did.</p>

<p class='c007'>The London <cite>Times</cite> clearly stated the foreign point of view:</p>

<p class='c012'>“It will not be our fault if the inopportune legislation of the North
combined with the reciprocity of wants between ourselves and the
South should bring about considerable modification in our relations
with America. No one after the recent debate on the slave trade
can doubt that England is still in earnest on this point, and will
never buy commercial advantage at the cost of her honor. We
should infinitely prefer dealing with a single responsible government
to maintaining two embassies and running the risk of misunderstandings
with two highly sensitive democracies. But the
tendencies of trade are inexorable, and our manufactures will
infallibly find their way to the best market with the regularity of
a mechanical law.... It may be the Southern population will
become our best customers.... Granted that a permanent
secession can be effected by a ‘peaceful appeal to the ballot-box,’
and that the moral and economical evils of slavery do not prove
fatal to a society based on it, material prosperity will not fail to
follow unrestricted intercourse, and the free States will long repent
an act which brings needless discredit on the intrinsic merits
of their cause.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This “discredit” to the cause grew in Europe as the days
went on. Not only did the bill hurt Northern trade and alienate
European sympathy, it was the chief reason the Confederates
had for thinking their new government would succeed.
It was driving trade to their ports, thus giving them money.
It was making Europe their friend, thus giving them position.
And nothing could be done. On all sides the Morrill tariff
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>was denounced as a stupidity, a blunder, an outrage. There
were even many demands for an extra session to repeal it.
Too late the Republicans saw that their first measure as a
party had been a mistake. And then suddenly the whole
situation of the unhappy bill was changed by the breaking
out of war between the North and South.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first and most imperative necessity in war is money, for
money means everything else—men, guns, ammunition.
Mr. Lincoln and his cabinet when they found in the spring
of 1861 that they were in for a war of more than 90 days, at
once called an extra session of Congress to provide the means
for carrying it on. It fell to Mr. Chase, the new Secretary of
the Treasury, to suggest what could be done. Practically our
whole income came at that time from duties on imported
goods. How could they be made to yield more? What
other sources of revenue could be tapped? Mr. Chase had
various suggestions to make, but it is with only one of them
that we have to do here—the raising of the tariff on imported
goods.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under other circumstances it would not have been agreeable
for Mr. Chase to suggest increased duties. All his life he had
been what the Whigs called a free trader—that is, he had
preached Democratic doctrines on the tariff. He was one
of a large number of leaders in the Republican party who had
originally been Democrats and who had joined the new organization
solely because of its anti-slavery sentiments, and who
had reluctantly swallowed the new party’s leanings towards
protection, hoping always, no doubt, to uproot them finally.
Mr. Chase had probably been the less inclined to make any
show of objection to the protectionist program of the new
organization because he had hoped to be its choice for president.
But Mr. Chase had not been his party’s choice for
president. On the contrary, he had been obliged to accept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>from his successful rival a portfolio for which he had no love
and no training—that of Secretary of the Treasury. Disappointed
as he was, badly used as he felt himself to be, he
undertook manfully the hard task of raising money for the
war. From the first his determination and confidence were
the firmest. The money was in the country. It must come
into the National Treasury, if not by one means, then by
another. “The war must go on,” he told the bankers who
hesitated to take his loans, in July, 1861, “until this rebellion
is put down, if we have to put out paper until it takes a thousand
dollars to buy a breakfast.” And when they gave him
their terms with a “this-is-our-ultimatum,” he replied,
“It is for me to make ultimatums; not you.” Higher
tariffs then instead of lower Mr. Chase naturally advised, and
he asked Congress to amend the Morrill Bill to this end.
Many of its duties he raised, articles which it placed on the
free list he took off. On many articles he arranged for a
double duty, that is, duty on both value and quantity, and
he tacked to the bill a direct tax of $20,000,000 to be divided
among the states and a tax on all incomes of over $800.
Mr. Chase expected from this measure as amended to get
something like $80,000,000 of the $318,000,000 he calculated
he would need in the next year (ending June 30, 1862).</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no delay in the adoption of the bill. Its worst
enemies were for it. Even the New York <cite>Evening Post</cite>, which
had fought the Morrill Bill with teeth and claws, which
had called it a “booby of a bill,” the “blunder of the age,”
now said resignedly that in the situation the best thing to do
was to “patch it up.” “The great object we have in view
during the continuance of the war by financial regulations,”
said the <cite>Post</cite>, “is to raise, in the easiest and least burdensome
manner, the largest possible amount of revenue. To
further this object, free traders can readily work with protectionists.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>War is an exceptional state and demands extraordinary
measures. For this reason we are prepared to
support a scale of duties at present which we should oppose
if the nation were at peace.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus, in less than five months after its passage the Morrill
Bill, a protectionist measure, framed when there was but
little protectionist sentiment in the country and made a law
by the signature of a Democratic president elected on a
platform of free trade throughout the world, a bill so changed
from its first condition that its author had been inclined to
abandon it, loaded with jobs, the cause of serious business
disturbances in the North, of the alienation of European sympathy,
of great gain and satisfaction to the South, had been
accepted with resignation by its most intelligent enemies.
Almost without knowing it the country had returned to a
policy which nearly 20 years before it had abandoned. It is
not too much to call the measure the foundation of a revolution
in our commercial life. Henry C. Cary, the economist,
did not greatly exaggerate its importance when he wrote
Mr. Morrill: “You have connected your name with what is
destined, I think, to prove the most important measure ever
adopted”; nor did Mr. Blaine when he said, in his Recollections,
that if the Morrill Bill had been passed under other
circumstances, it would have been regarded as an “era in
the history of the government.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Chase had calculated that the receipts from the
amended Morrill Bill would amount to about $80,000,000 a
year, but they fell far short—only about 51 millions, of
which the customs yielded 49 millions. The expenses of the
war increased at a frightful rate, and it was soon evident that
the struggle was to be longer than had been expected. Early
in 1862 new schemes of taxation began to be considered. The
result was that the Ways and Means Committee decided to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>ask Congress to pass an internal revenue bill, and still further
to add to the duties provided for in the Morrill Bill. It was
in June when the two new measures came from the committee.
Taken together they were calculated to make the country
gasp. The tax bill touched almost every article of daily life.
It provided for licenses on a man’s business whatever it
was—running a bowling alley, a hotel, or an attorney’s
office; for taxes on his income and his inheritances, on his
carriages, his gold watch, his silver plate; for revenue stamps
on the documents he signed, the telegrams he sent, the matches
he struck; nothing that he ate or drank or made escaped. The
direct taxation on manufactured articles was so high that in
many cases it would have acted as a bonus to foreigners to
bring in their goods if the Ways and Means Committee had
not foreseen this, and aimed to amend the tariff law so
that increased duties would compensate for the internal
taxes. As might have been expected from the hurried way
in which the bill had been prepared, the duties intended as
compensations were not always exact. Sometimes, as in the
case of books and umbrellas, they were insufficient, and the
foreigner could bring over his wares and undersell the overtaxed
domestic producer. Again, the duties were in excess
of the direct taxes and served only to protect the home manufacturer
in extortionate prices. Thaddeus Stevens, the chairman
of the Committee, and Mr. Morrill both explained to the
House with great care that the whole scheme of the changes
was to make the additional duty cover as nearly as possible
the internal taxes. “If we bleed manufacturers we must see
that the proper tonic is administered at the same time,” said
Mr. Morrill. Any duty not compensatory was placed purely
for revenue reasons. In no case, they said, were the new duties
for protective purposes—the whole change must be regarded
as “temporary”—a war measure, and nothing else.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>It was a foregone conclusion that the bills whatever their
provisions would pass, for the people were actually demanding
taxation, that the war might be properly waged. Nevertheless,
there was much bitter remonstrance at the duplication
of taxes, which in certain cases was excessive and unjust.
Take the newspaper business, for instance. Almost everything
a printing house used was taxed—paper paid 3 per
cent; a duty was put also on rags imported for paper making,
which still further raised the price; the advertising
income was taxed. Revenue stamps were required on every
telegram a member of the staff sent, on every check made out,
on every official paper signed. When the bill was under consideration,
the New York <cite>Herald</cite> computed that it would
add from thirty to forty thousand dollars a year to its expenses.
The <cite>Herald</cite> got great joy out of the situation. <i>It</i>
could afford the expense, but in its judgment no other New
York newspaper could, and in a long and interesting editorial
(July 1, 1862) it said, jubilantly: “Many papers will be
killed, but the <cite>Tribune</cite> and the <cite>Evening Post</cite> will die first.
They have no advertising patronage and but very little circulation,
and so by a just retribution of Providence they will be
the first victims of the taxation which they have brought upon
us by causing our Civil War.” The comforting assurance of
the destruction of his two hated contemporaries, combined
with the disgust and anger of England over the increased duties,
gave Mr. Bennett such satisfaction at this time that he became
almost benevolent towards the Lincoln administration.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Greeley did not share Mr. Bennett’s conviction that the
<cite>Tribune</cite> would be destroyed by the new taxes, for he wrote
Mr. Morrill:</p>

<p class='c012'>“If newspapers are to be taxed at all, their advertising can bear
it best, as it is a source of profit which circulation is not. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>can stand 2 mills per pound on paper—though that will be a
pretty productive tax. I think that item alone will cost the
<cite>Tribune</cite> establishment $7000 per annum, all to come out of profits
that can’t be made in these times. Still taxes must be put on—only
do give us some substantial retrenchment—especially of
mileage—to go to the people on.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The House passed the new bill promptly. Even if it had
felt more seriously than it did the objections to it there would
have been little chance of delay, for the chairman of the Ways
and Means Committee, Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania,
was a dictator who tolerated little interference with any
measure he approved. Mr. Stevens at this time was a man
of 70, sombre and gaunt, with rugged features, deep-set eyes,
and a splendid brow. He was lame, a club foot, and his
health was permanently broken. But never had his wit
been keener, his sarcasm more biting, his eloquence greater,
his will more indomitable. He understood Congressional
tactics as few men ever have, and he was a filibuster of first
order. He was frequently unscrupulous in getting what he
wanted. If <i>he</i> wanted it, it must be right and the means
were a secondary consideration. Stevens always stood by his
own, right or wrong, not that he entertained illusions about
his Republican colleagues. “Which one is our d——d
rascal?” he asked one day when called upon to vote in a
contested election case, and “our d——d rascal” got his
vote. The last thing Stevens would allow was delay
over revenue bills. If a member took to questions he considered
immaterial in the debate he hauled him back
sharply to his muttons, and it was a rash man indeed who
offended a second time. Only one thing would send him
off on a tangent, and that was an effort to secure some advantage
over a man of another race or color. In the debate
on the present bill, for instance, he broke out in a fiery denunciation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>of California because the representatives were
trying to secure a high duty on cleaned rice, which the Chinese
used almost exclusively. The Californians frankly avowed
that the duty was intended as a discrimination against the
Chinaman. Stevens was at them in an instant, the engineering
of the bill quite forgotten, in a hot speech against the injustice
of their attitude.</p>

<p class='c007'>That there was discrimination possible against your white
fellow-man in applying a protective tariff, Stevens seems
never to have understood. Duties were never too high for
him, particularly on iron, for he was an iron manufacturer
as well as a lawyer, and it was often said in Pennsylvania that
the duties he advocated in no way represented the large iron
interests of the state, but were hoisted to cover the needs of his
own small and badly managed works. He was as unsound
on all financial matters as he was on protection. He wanted
to pay the war debt in greenbacks, had a horror of gold going
out of the country, and once proposed a law forbidding it to
be bought and sold. But taken all in all, Thaddeus Stevens
was probably what the House needed in the crisis, a prejudiced,
violent dictator, with a holy passion for the Union
cause. Such men get things done if the after-cost of their
work is heavy. Stevens soon sent the tax and tariff bills
to the Senate, where, if not greatly improved, they were
passed with promptness. Considerable suspicion was popularly
attached to many of the Senate changes in the excise
bill, particularly because of the close connection with it of
Senator Simmons of Rhode Island. The Senator’s connection
with the Morrill Bill which had won him the sobriquet of
“Wood-Screw” Simmons has been referred to above. It was
fresh in public mind then. He still further distinguished
himself at the time he was engineering the tax bill by a gun
contract so unsavory that it had to be investigated. It was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>shown beyond quibble that he had been promised $50,000
for getting a contract for one of his constituents and that he
had already received some thousands of the money. The
Senator did not pretend to deny the fact, but he declared
his transaction to be “strictly legal.” The committee was
severe on him. He had no more right to sell his influence, they
said, than his vote, both were “the property of the country”;
but they intimated that as he was really no worse than many
of his colleagues, it was better to let him off, and let off he
was, though he soon resigned. The affair did not raise the
tax bill in the estimation of the public, nor increase public
confidence in the merits of the compensating tariffs which
accompanied it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The passing of the bill went almost unnoticed by the press,
so engrossed were the people in war. (It was the summer
of McClellan’s Virginia campaign.) A few newspapers of
free-trade principles tried to make an issue of it, but without
success. Mr. Greeley came out in the <cite>Tribune</cite> declaring
that he would not be drawn into a discussion on protection
as long as the war lasted. Indeed there was room for little
on the wonderful editorial page of the <cite>Tribune</cite>, where Horace
Greeley stripped bare his agonized heart, but the war and
the emancipation of the slave. Greeley, too, was satisfied
enough to let protection reëstablish itself through a revenue
bill, for if there was anything which he held almost as sacred
as human liberty, it was the doctrine of protection to American
industries. Greeley saw protection as an actual wealthproducer,
and when the Morrill Bill was up in  1860, he declared:
“We have as undoubting faith that this bill if passed
would add at least $100,000,000 per annum to the earnings
and wages of labor throughout the country as we have that
the sun will rise to-morrow.” He was one of a very few men
in public life whose belief was something more than an inheritance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>from Henry Clay. In one of his Institute talks
he once told how he became a protectionist:</p>

<p class='c012'>“From early boyhood I had sat at the feet of Hezekiah Niles,
Henry Clay and Walter Forward and Rollin C. Mallary, and other
champions of this doctrine, and I had attained from a perusal of
theirs and kindred writings and speeches a most undoubting conviction
that the policy they commended was eminently calculated
to impel our country swiftly and surely onward through activity
and prosperity to greatness and well-assured well-being. I had
studied the question dispassionately, for the journals accessible
to my boyhood were mainly those of Boston, then almost if not
quite unanimously hostile to protection; but the arguments they
combated seemed to me far stronger than those they advanced,
and I early became an earnest and ardent disciple of the schools
of Niles and Carey, and could not doubt that the policy they commended
was that best calculated to lead a country of vast and
undeveloped resources like ours up from rude poverty and dependence
to skilled efficiency, wealth, and power.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It is undoubtedly true that the mantle of the early protectionist
advocates Niles and Carey fell on Horace Greeley,
and that what the one did in the “Register” and the other
in his pamphlets, Greeley continued in the <cite>Tribune</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was much calculating on all sides of the amount
the new tax bills would yield. <cite>Harper’s Weekly</cite> at the start
estimated that it would be $185,000,000, and in November
(1862) it said the amount would be nearer $275,000,000,
but it was far too sanguine. At the end of the year (June,
1863) it was found that the customs had yielded less than
$64,000,000 and the excise only about $41,000,000, and the
country had been spending in the last two years an average
of over one and one-half millions a day. The funds raised by
taxation were a bagatelle beside the enormous loans which
had to be made, the legal tender which had to be issued. By
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>the beginning of 1864 it became evident to Mr. Lincoln and his
cabinet that more money must be raised by taxation. It was
not a popular thing to do, for the slow progress of the war, the
awful cost in life and money, had raised a strong party against
Lincoln. It looked as if he might not be reëlected. The opportunists
around him advised against any measures which
would increase dissatisfaction, but Mr. Lincoln wanted no
misunderstanding about his intentions in regard to the war.
It had got to be finished at all cost, and he wanted the
people to understand what his reëlection meant. He asked
them for more men and more money, another draft, higher
taxes, higher tariffs. The raising of the tariff was as a method
much less disturbing to Lincoln than imposing direct taxes.
He had the old Whig’s horror of the tax-collector, and indeed
had pictured effectively in his early campaigning “assessors
and collectors going forth like swarms of Egyptian locusts, devouring
every blade of grass and other green thing.” In 1859,
when there was a general curiosity as to what he believed, a correspondent
asked him as to his tariff views, and he replied:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I was an old Henry Clay-Tariff-Whig in old times, and made
more speeches on that subject than any other. I have not since
changed my views. I believe yet, if we could have a moderate,
carefully-adjusted protective tariff, so far acquiesced in as not to
be a perpetual subject of political strife, squabbles, changes and
uncertainties, it would be better for us. Still it is my opinion that
just now the revival of that question will not advance the cause
itself or the man who revives it.... We, the old Whigs, have
been entirely beaten out on the tariff question, and we shall not be
able to reëstablish the policy until the absence of it shall have
demonstrated the necessity for it in the minds of men heretofore
opposed to it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In May,  1860, he was still of the same opinion on making the
tariff an issue. “I now think,” he wrote the same correspondent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>“that the tariff question ought not to be agitated
in the Chicago Convention, but that all should be satisfied
on that point with a presidential candidate whose antecedents
give assurance that he would neither seek to force a tariff
law by executive influence nor yet to arrest a reasonable one
by a veto or otherwise.” After his nomination and election he
steadily refused to say anything on the question. It was not,
in fact, until February 15 (1861), when he reached Pittsburg
on his way to his inauguration, that he uttered a word. In
Pennsylvania, however, some expression was unavoidable.
The tariff had played a greater part in that state in electing Mr.
Lincoln than had slavery and unionism. Indeed, Mr. Blaine
does not hesitate to say that if Governor Curtin had not spent
most of his time in the campaign advocating protection,
the state would have gone Democratic, and if Pennsylvania
had gone Democratic, Mr. Lincoln would probably have been
defeated. An expression of opinion then was unavoidable,
and he gave it;—certainly it was moderate enough. After
quoting the tariff plank of the party platform he said modestly:
 “I have by no means a thoroughly matured judgment
upon this subject, especially as to details.... I have long
thought it would be to our advantage to produce any necessary
article at home which can be made of as good quality and
with as little labor at home as abroad. At least by the difference
of the carrying from abroad. In such cases the carrying
is demonstrably a dead loss of labor....” After developing
this argument, which was one of his strongest early ones
and the only one of which full notes have been saved to us,
he added: “The condition of the Treasury would seem to
render an early revision of the tariff indispensable,” and he
went on to advise “every gentleman who knows he is to be a
member of the next Congress to take an enlarged view and
post himself thoroughly so as to contribute his part to such an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>adjustment of the tariff as shall produce a sufficient revenue,
and in its other bearings, so far as possible, be just and equal to
all sections of the country and classes of the people.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There is nothing to show that after he reached Washington
Mr. Lincoln ever considered the tariff other than as one of
the several methods by which money could be raised. If he
saw, as he probably did, that there were many injustices in
the measures passed, that some duties were too high for
revenue and beneficial only to the special interests which
had fought for them, that others were trades outright, he still
knew that, all things considered, the bills were as good as
could be expected. It is probable indeed that none of the
important legislation of the war received less attention from
the president than the tariff bills.</p>

<p class='c007'>Congress was with the president in 1864 in his insistence on
means for finishing the war, and in June a new tariff bill went
to the Senate. It had been out of committee just eight days
when it was adopted by the House and the debate on it lasted
less than two days. The Senate was even more expeditious,
for it was reported there on the 14th, taken up on the 16th, and
passed on the 17th. That it was possible so to push the bill
through was due to the wonderful generalship of the chairman
of the Senate Committee on Finance, William Pitt Fessenden
of Maine, a man whom Charles Sumner once declared to have
been in the financial field what all our best generals were in
arms. Fessenden was at this time about 58 years old, and he
had been in the Senate for nearly ten years. Before the slavery
question called him into public life, he had stood at the head
of the Maine bar, a position his father had occupied for forty
years before him. He was an untiring student, a clear
thinker, and a forcible and convincing speaker. He had great
dignity—“the dignity of a Cato,” one of his acquaintances
has said, but he combined with it “the bitterness of a Junius.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Certain things were sure to arouse him—buncombe, misrepresentation,
jobbery, and—<i>Charles Sumner</i>. His propensity
to quarrel with Sumner was chronic. He seemed to
take as a personal insult Sumner’s untiring fight in war times to
keep a tariff off books, rags for paper making, magazines,
philosophical apparatus for schools and works of art. Sumner
never lost a chance to declare these tariffs “barbaric,” “taxes
on knowledge.” “Why should not knowledge pay as well
as everything else?” Fessenden would ask. This is war,
and these tariffs are justified by the circumstances. Why
should not rags pay? and he intimated that he knew well the
gentleman in Boston who made paper and who had stirred
Sumner up to make an attack on the rag duty. Besides,
why should not American ragpickers be protected as well as
American wool-growers? It was an industry to be cultivated.</p>

<p class='c007'>But while Fessenden’s antagonism to Sumner coupled with
his dyspepsia might make him often irascible, it never interfered
with getting things done. The bill in question was put
through with only two days’ debate, purely from his ability
to whip the members into prompt action—to his quick wit,
his fine tact in steering them away from unprofitable side
issues and from subjects which precipitated heated and time-taking
discussion. For instance, in the present bill the higher
duty proposed on railroad iron caused great anxiety to railroad
interests, especially in the West, where much building was
going on. The duty on railroad iron in the bill of 1861 had
been $12.00 per ton; it was proposed now to make it 70 cents
per 100 pounds. The whole West rose in arms. Kansas and
Minnesota were particularly disturbed, since they were laying
track as rapidly as possible. It cost from two to three
thousand dollars a mile for rails now, and nobody knew what
it would cost if duties were raised. It looked very much as
if railroad building would be stopped. “The development
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>of the country was something even in war times,” urged the
Senator from Minnesota. This tariff meant less revenue,
Senator Pomeroy of Kansas declared, for importation would
cease. It simply meant that the iron men who were demanding
it would put up their prices. They were paying 50 per
cent dividends now and watering their stock. The entire
iron business was rapidly becoming a monopoly. We could
better afford to import all our iron from England than let
this happen. But the suggestion of importing anything from
England at that moment was like fire to powder. An explosion
always followed. Mr. Pomeroy’s suggestion brought
Zach Chandler of Michigan roaring to his feet. “If I had
my way,” he shouted, “I would raise a wall of fire between this
nation and Great Britain. I would not only not allow her
iron to come here, but I would not let a single pound of any
article she manufactured come here during this war.... Let
the railroad interest suffer and any other interest suffer. It
is nothing to me, I am for the tax and the highest tax.”
Mr. Fessenden well understood the danger in allowing an outbreak
against England to start, and he quietly and firmly
insisted that the discussion be confined to the duty on rails.</p>

<p class='c007'>The new bill was signed on June 30, and went into effect
at once. Under it duties rose from the 37 per cent of the
bill of 1862 to over 47 per cent. The effect on prices was
appalling. The cost of living, already enormous, increased,
until it looked as if the “thousand-dollar breakfast” Secretary
Chase had threatened was to come; even goods unembarrassed
by taxes or tariffs, like butter and eggs, rose with
the rest—sympathy and speculation the causes. In some
cases the hoisting of prices almost caused riot. In New York
and Brooklyn there was great excitement over the attempts of
the gas companies and the street railroads to take their taxes
out of the public, although it had been expressly stipulated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>that they were to pay them themselves. In August after
the bill went into force, the Manhattan Gas Company notified
customers that they must pay $3.25 per thousand instead
of $2.50; the Brooklyn Gas Light Company and several others
did the same. Higher fares on the street car lines were
announced. There was a great uproar in the press and on
the street, for it was well known that the companies were already
making enormous profits. The Manhattan Gas stock
at this time was quoted at $1.90 (50 being par) and New
York Gas Light at $2.85¼ (50 par). Confiscation of franchises
and the establishment of municipal plants were advocated
generally. In Philadelphia there was an agitation at
the same time in favor of coöperative coal companies, the
price of coal, which it was estimated cost $6.00 per ton delivered,
being put at $10.00. If the indignant cities had
carried out their threats they would probably by this time
have been free of their most arrogant task-masters.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hard as the situation was made for common folks, they
endured it patiently, grimly, convinced that there was no
other way to end the war. There has never been seen,
indeed, in the world’s history, a more splendid courage in
bearing burdens than the people of the United States—North
and South—showed in the Civil War. It is an inspiring
thing to study. If it had had no reverse! But it is one of
the curious and puzzling phenomena of human nature that
the situation which inspires some to their highest endeavor
arouses others to their lowest. That the same cause makes
martyrs of some men, cormorants of others. If a war for a
great cause brings out the nobler qualities of human nature,
it brings out at the same time the vicious. If fine fellows
march in the line and go bravely into battle, mean ones hang
on their flanks and rob the battlefield. If the mass of people
pay the cost by the sweat of their brow, a minority trades
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>on their necessity. Never have we had this violent contrast
more marked than in the Civil War. Take the attitude of
the people towards the taxes and tariff. The mass bore the
burdens imposed without a whimper, yet from the first there
was a large number whose sole aim was to manipulate taxes
and tariff to serve their interests. They ignored the principles
the makers of the bills laid down clearly, that everything was
to have a duty put on it which could be made to yield revenue.
The consumers of raw materials fought fiercely for free wool,
free cocoa, free everything, and they fought as hard for increased
duties on their products; not satisfied that these
duties compensate for internal taxes, they wanted them
higher than the taxes. The government was the best patron
of importers and manufacturers, and it was a customer
not too careful that it got what it bargained for, such
was the stress of its situation, and these manufacturers
and importers cheated their great patron at every turn.
They gave shoddy for wool, adulterated the food they sold,
undercounted and underweighed. Frequently what they
sold had been smuggled in, for smuggling flourished abundantly
under the high duties. All that free traders had
ever said of the inducement the protective system gave for
cheating the government was more than proved true. An
organized system of smuggling from Canada was in operation
before the end of 1862, and it grew steadily throughout the
war until it was an open secret that the markets of Boston
particularly were full of smuggled goods. The closest watch
had to be kept for this reason, on every attempt to put a duty
on an article hitherto free. Thus in 1864 Mr. Fessenden
stopped a proposed tariff on spices. He had discovered, he
said, that the gentlemen who imported spices had already
on hand in warehouses a great quantity held for the higher
prices which the duty would cause, and that full preparations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>had been made to keep up this supply by smuggling
from Canada—an easy thing to do, since anybody could
fill his pockets with nutmegs and walk in unnoticed. The
cost of guarding the border became enormous, three times the
ordinary number of revenue cutters were on the Lakes, and
a cordon of officers extended from Maine to the Pacific coast.
Besides, the management of the custom houses throughout
the war was notoriously bad, the service being sprinkled with
the incompetent and dishonest. In New York alone it was
estimated that the government lost from 12 to 25 millions
annually through fraud—then as now false invoices being
the favorite method of cheating.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the adherents of free trade and direct taxation could
not boast that their system gave no opportunity for like
abuses. The men who fought for higher duties fought against
excise. They made false returns of income and property
in the same way that importers made false invoices. If
importers brought in great quantities of unprotected goods
and then organized a campaign for protection, manufacturers
in anticipation of taxes piled up huge stocks; 40 millions of
gallons of distilled spirits and nearly 80 millions of cigars were
made and stored in anticipation of the tax of 1864. When it
was seen that matches were to be taxed, stocks were so piled
up that the first year the government collected only a small
proportion of its estimate. After the stock was exhausted
the return from the tax on matches increased 216 per cent in
five months; then the manufacturers devised a new trick;
they put 100 instead of 50 matches in a box. The law required
only one stamp on a box—thus the tax was cut in two.
Factories were transported across the Canadian border; and
as the reciprocity treaty let matches in free, it began to look
before the close of the war as if the match tax would be null.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the whole, it is probable that the collection of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>direct tax was accompanied by less fraud than the collection
of the customs, but the service made up in inefficiency what
it may have lacked in dishonesty. The taxed were on the
alert to escape, and the collectors were too inexperienced
to circumvent them.</p>

<p class='c007'>There certainly never has been in this country so admirable
an opportunity to compare these two systems of raising
revenue as we had at this period. The amount each yielded,
the expense and difficulty of collection, the effect on the loyalty
of the people and the opportunity for greed and dishonesty—all
can be placed in parallel columns for comparison. If anything
is proven by the comparison it is that no system of
organization and administration does away with human selfishness;
that whatever the system, the men who have it in
their hearts to cheat their fellows, are going to find a way.
Regeneration lies deeper than system: it lies in the nature of
the men who use the system.</p>

<p class='c007'>On March 31, 1865, the last tariff bill of the Civil War
was passed, an amendment raising many duties, among others
that on railroad iron. Nine days after it was passed Lee surrendered,
and almost as soon as the news reached Washington
orders went forth to stop many of the extraordinary measures
which war had made imperative. It had been declared
from the first that the high tariff and the direct taxes were
simply and only measures for war revenue. In framing the
tariff bill of 1862 the committee entitled it a bill to increase
duties “<i>temporarily</i>.” Mr. Morrill, Mr. Stevens, and Mr.
Fessenden all explained again and again that the increased
duties were to compensate for excise taxes. There are repeated
passages from their speeches of the same tenor as
this from Mr. Fessenden in 1864: “The tariff is adjusted
and was adjusted upon the simple principle with reference
to the internal tax.” Sumner reiterated the idea whenever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>he had the chance. “I regard all our present legislation
as temporary or provisional in its character,” he said in
1864, when an irate fellow Senator pointed out the growing
hardihood of manufacturers in demanding protection
and the danger of fastening high duties irrevocably on the
country. “It is to meet the exigency of the hour.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nothing is clearer indeed than that in the minds of the men
who devised them—in the minds of the people who paid
them, the tariffs with which the country found itself in 1865
were temporary, just as the army was temporary, the internal
taxes temporary, that with the end of the war they would
come off. But a war does not “end” with the laying down
of the musket. That is but the turning point in the fever.
The consequences are left to take care of—tens of thousands
of men to detach from army life and reassimilate into civilian
life; thousands of maimed and weakened soldiers to find occupation
and homes for; thousands of widows and orphans
to care for. It is over forty years since Lee surrendered to
Grant, but the army of the Civil War is still with us.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nor does the laying down of the musket put an end to
the cost. War means debt. It is fought on a nation’s
credit—not wholly on its income—not on its surplus,
and the debt remains. When the government at Washington
came to consider its financial condition in 1865 after the so-called
“end of the war,” it found itself with the colossal debt
of over <i>twenty-eight hundred million dollars</i> ($2,808,549,437.55
to be exact). Interest on this must be paid. The principal
must be paid. Tariffs and taxes might be “temporary,”
but it was evident that they must be adjusted to take care of
the war debt. How was it to be done? It was evident that
between redeeming its pledge to make the taxes temporary
and meeting its obligations the government of the United
States had a very pretty financial problem on its hands.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II<br /> <span class='large'>AN OUTBREAK OF PROTECTIONISM</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The Civil War wrought many changes in the people of
the United States, and none more amazing than that in their
attitude toward money—the amount they could spend—the
methods by which it could be raised. Here was a people
who in 1859 had looked with dismay on a debt of $58,000,000
facing confidently one of $2,800,000,000; a people to whom
in  1860 raising an income of $62,000,000 had seemed difficult,
actually provided in 1866 one of $559,000,000; a people to
whom direct taxes had always been abhorrent and who had
repudiated high tariffs, submitting patiently to both as one
of the dire necessities of war. The war was over, but the
debt and the extraordinary expenses remained, and to meet
them harsh and sweeping taxation must be continued.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was plain to everybody, but it was equally plain to
those who studied the balance sheet of the treasury that many
things could be done to equalize and reduce the taxation.
The debt itself could be readjusted to be much less burdensome.
As it stood it was made up of some twenty different
kinds of paper;—bonds, treasury notes, certificates of indebtedness
of all kinds due at nearly twenty different dates, and
drawing almost as many different rates of interest. The
paper currency which kept the money market in a constant
state of unrest could be redeemed. Great economies could
be made in the administration of the government. These
things done and a careful estimate of essential expenses computed,
nobody had any doubt but that the people would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>consent to the taxation required with as little grumbling as
human nature usually meets taxes.</p>

<p class='c007'>That the revision of the revenue was work for experts, not
for politicians, had been realized before Mr. Lincoln’s death,
and in March, 1865, a commission had been appointed to look
into the whole subject and report. The head of this commission
was a man who was to wield a big influence in the country
in the next few years, and one to whom we owe more credit
than he has ever received, David A. Wells. Mr. Wells was
a New England man, who had first attracted attention by
planning and constructing in the printing office of the Springfield
<cite>Republican</cite>, where he wrote editorials, the first machine
ever made for folding newspapers. He made money from
his invention, and used some of it in giving himself a scientific
training at Harvard as a special pupil of Louis Agassiz. In
1864 Mr. Wells, who had become interested in economic
problems, wrote a pamphlet, called “Our Burden and Our
Strength,” which attracted general attention, both here and
abroad, and led naturally enough to his choice as one of the
revenue commission referred to above. There were two
other members on the commission, but from the beginning
Mr. Wells dominated it, and his first report, made January 1,
1866, showed in a very clear way what was before the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>By his calculations the taxes and tariffs then in force ought
to yield in the year ending June 30, 1867, $435,000,000.
Now the Secretary of the Treasury had estimated that we
could get along that year on $284,000,000. Let us say three
hundred millions, proposed Mr. Wells, and then let us set
aside fifty millions a year for reducing the debt—that still
leaves $85,000,000 to be taken off the taxes. Where should
it be applied? To the internal taxes or to the custom duties?
Mr. Wells knew the feeling of the people. They hated direct
taxation, they preferred duties on imports, and he worked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>out a plan for taking the $85,000,000 off the former, but at
the same time he called attention to various inequalities in
the tariff which should be corrected. They came mainly
from the lack of equalization between the two systems of
taxation. The duties on imports were supposed to be arranged
so as to compensate for the internal taxation; not
infrequently, however, the tariffs were placed without proper
consideration, and grave inequalities had resulted. These
were of two kinds: either the tariff was less than the taxes,
so that the manufacturer could not compete with foreign
goods imported, or it was considerably higher than the taxes,
so that he could put up his prices until they practically prohibited
importation, thus cutting off revenue and heavily
burdening the consumer. Certain cases of the first kind
became familiar at the time from the fact that they touched
everybody, and were explained clearly and in detail in Mr.
Wells’s report. There was the matter of book-making. Everything
which went to make a book was <i>separately</i> taxed,—paper,
cloth, boards, glue, thread, gold-leaf, leather, and type,—and
when the book was complete it was taxed 5 per cent on
the selling price. It cost 59½ cents to make a book requiring
a pound of paper. The same book could be made in England
and delivered in New York, including duty (the duty on
books was 25% on the value) for 26¼ cents. Little wonder
that American book publishers sent their work abroad
to be done or that the boys and girls of the time were
using Webster’s Spelling Books made in England. The
umbrella was another common article over which there was
much trouble. Each item which went into the making of the
umbrella—sticks, rods, handles, tips, bands, tassels, buttons,
cover—was produced by a different establishment, and
each paid its own tax. The cover usually was imported,
and silk paid a duty of 60 per cent. The finished parasol
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>paid a 6 per cent tax. Now the duty on an imported umbrella
was 35 per cent on its value. Naturally umbrellas were
imported in quantities and sold at a price lower than they
could be made for at home.</p>

<p class='c007'>But while there were cases where the tariff did not compensate
for the tax there were more where it had been forced
far beyond it. If these tariffs had increased the revenue, they
might, under the circumstances, have been justified, but they
did not do that. They limited importation and enabled the
home manufacturer to put up his prices, and it was he, not
the government, who got the extra money. At the same
time it cost the government a great deal to collect the small
sums realized on these over-protected articles, often more than
the sum itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the government could get on with $85,000,000 less than it
could collect, it seemed obvious that it ought to begin cutting
down those internal taxes which were so much too high for
the tariffs. It seemed obvious, too, that unremunerative
tariffs ought to be cut off. But no sooner did the talk of
reducing tariffs on any article begin than there came a loud
outburst from many manufacturing centres against any
reduction. The internal taxes must come off at once—that
they demanded, but no tariffs should be lowered. The cry
to preserve the tariffs soon turned in many mouths to one to
raise them. Copper (in blocks), which under the bill of 1864
had had a duty of 2½ cents a pound, now asked for double
that. Iron rails which already were carrying a duty of 70
cents a hundred pounds and selling in New York for over
$80 a ton, while they cost only about $32 in Wales, asked a
higher duty. The salt miners of Michigan and New York,
whose profits at the moment were enormous, demanded still
greater protection. As soon as the House Committee of
Ways and Means got to work on a tariff bill, which was early
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>in 1866, an army of determined tariff lobbyists poured
into Washington, declaring they must have more protection
or they would perish.</p>

<p class='c007'>That there were grave embarrassments in the business of
the country could not be denied. Five hundred thousand
men, young men at that, had been taken permanently from
the ranks of breadwinners by the war—and those dependent
upon them were now the country’s wards. Immigration to
which the government had looked for reënforcements for
labor was falling off. The tremendous demand which a great
army makes upon manufactures of all kinds was at an end.
Particularly did the iron mills, the woollen factories, the railroads,
the produce merchants, feel this sudden cessation of
trade. Prices were probably 90 per cent higher than before
the war, although wages were not over 60 per cent higher.
But these embarrassments were the inevitable results of war—as
logical as the debt or the disabled soldier. Somehow the
transition from the abnormal condition of war to the normal
one of peace had to be made; somehow for the artificial
demand and cost the natural must be substituted. It meant
economy, curtailment, lower prices, lessened output; hard
times, in short, for a period. There was no class in the
country from whom patient endurance of the difficulties of
the situation could be more fairly asked than the manufacturers.
They had for the most part enjoyed four as fat
years as ever fell to the lot of man. It is doubtful indeed if
any industry at any period of the world’s history had reaped
so great rewards in so short a time as that of iron in the
Civil War.</p>

<p class='c007'>The difficulty now was that these manufacturers were not
willing to pay their share of the cost of the war. They demanded
higher protection that they might make their prices
higher, and thus ease as much as possible the necessarily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>hard transition state. Congress was to do for them what
economy and patience should have done.</p>

<p class='c007'>As it happened the demands for a higher protection were
made on a Congress under the dictatorship of a man for whom
no tariff could ever be too high—that was Thaddeus Stevens.
When the first tariff bill was presented to the House in June,
1866, by Mr. Morrill, everybody knew Stevens was near his
end, but emaciated, white, and suffering as he was, his nerve
was still superb. Too weak to walk up the Capitol steps,
two stalwart negroes carried him. “Who will carry me when
you are dead, boys?” he said to them one day with a chuckle.
The fight between Congress and President Johnson over
Reconstruction had developed, and Johnson had already
singled out Stevens as his chief enemy. He was soon to
begin to ask as he “swung around the circle,” “Why not hang
Thad Stevens?” Johnson was not mistaken in placing the
responsibility. Stevens had always disliked him. “Can’t
you find a candidate for vice-president of the United States
without going down to one of those damned rebel provinces to
pick up one?” he had asked Colonel McClure in 1864. His
dislike had grown to open opposition, and he was now leading
the Congressional fight with spirit, ability, and bitterness.
Yet weak as he was, and absorbed as he was in the undoing
of the sullen suffering man at the other end of Pennsylvania
Avenue, no measure escaped his dictation, least of
all a measure which touched a doctrine so dear to his heart
as the protection of American industry.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bill was not in before it was evident Stevens was dissatisfied
with it. It was, he declared vehemently, a free-trade
measure. As a matter of fact no bill the United States
Congress had seen up to this date had less consolation for
the free-trader in it than the one Mr. Morrill now introduced.
Although just before the bill was reported
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>$75,000,000 had been taken from the internal revenue taxes,
no compensating reduction had been made in the tariff. Not
only did it preserve the average of 47 per cent, which the bill
of 1864 imposed, but it increased many duties, notably those
on copper, iron, steel rails, wool and woollen goods, salt, all
articles which touched the mass of consumers. Many purely
protective duties which could yield no revenue were added—such
were the duties proposed on grindstones and on nickel.
So inconsistent was the bill with the former professions of
the party, so evident was it that it was going to make the
price of many essential articles higher, that Mr. Morrill,
candid gentleman that he was, apologized rather pathetically
for it. He had hoped, he said in course of debate, that at the
close of the war the tariff had reached its maximum, and that
the earliest business of Congress after taking off internal taxes
on manufactures would be to reduce duties by the full compensating
amount. That this could not be done with safety
was due in his mind entirely to the failure of Congress to redeem
the currency. As long as there was $917,000,000 of paper
money in circulation Mr. Morrill thought the tariff could not
be lowered, but ought rather to be raised. His argument was
not particularly clear or convincing, but it was obvious that
he believed what he said, and that he was greatly worried over
the situation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Morrill’s doleful apology for raising duties was entirely
misplaced as far as the dominant factor in Congress was
concerned. It was not the higher duties which stirred that
body to protest against the bill, it was the lower; it was not
the extravagant increases, it was the moderate ones; it
was not the articles added, it was those omitted. Thus,
among other items in the schedule was one making the duty
on Nova Scotia coal 50 cents a ton, although the duty
on coal from other points was $1.25 a ton. This discrimination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>was, of course, for the sake of New England manufacturers,
who were cut off from using native coal by the freight
charges of the long haul. Again, scrap iron was not protected
at all and shoddy had a duty only <i>four</i> times what it
had been formerly! These and other similar changes in the
bill were not fairly before the House when Stevens broke out
in anger at the moderation of the measure. “I look upon this
bill as a free trade bill from beginning to end,” he stormed.
Nova Scotia coal should pay the full tariff of $1.25, and that
was not enough. There was not a word about scrap iron in
the bill, shoddy should pay more. “It is a most extraordinary
imposition upon the protective tariff of the country.” But
Stevens was physically too weak to do justice to his indignation—more
than once when he tried to address the House
he sank back into his seat, exclaiming, “I am too exhausted,”
but if he could not defend his doctrine, he had a Pennsylvania
colleague who could, and far more cunningly, with far more
knowledge and fairness than Stevens. This was William D.
Kelley of Philadelphia. Kelley at once took hold of the
debate on the bill, his whole weight being thrown in favor
of the highest protection of any article which could be made
or grown in the United States. His knowledge of the articles
on which he spoke, and his eloquence, clearness, and conviction
in presentation, were such as to mark him at once as the
probable future leader of the high protectionists.</p>

<p class='c007'>But bold, able, and determined as the protectionist sentiment
in the House showed itself, it was not to go unchallenged.
A species of three-cornered fight developed within the party.
There was Mr. Morrill defending while deploring the bill,
on the ground that paper currency made it necessary,—there
were the high protectionists led by Mr. Stevens in spirit and
Mr. Kelley in speech, and there was a most interesting body
of moderate protectionists, led by three representatives from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Iowa, John A. Kasson, James F. Wilson, and William B.
Allison. These men were ably seconded by Frederick A. Pike
of Maine (“tax-fight-emancipate Pike”) and Henry Raymond
of New York. Ridicule, protest, argument, were in
turn tried by this group. “It is well understood that there
are many very worthy manufacturers of coffee in this country,”
Mr. Pike said in disgust one day; “they make it of
chicory, beans, peas, rye, wheat, dandelion root, and many other
things. So there is reason for retaining a small duty on coffee
in order to protect that worthy class of our manufacturers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Raymond, who was indignant over the increased duty
on railroad iron—a duty which he declared would increase
the annual expenses of the two roads in his state, the Erie
and the Central, at least $2,000,000—exclaimed: “If the
bill of 1865 is not sufficient protection, what in Heaven’s
name will be? We were told at the beginning if we protected
this infant industry it would soon stand alone. We have
been doing it for thirty or forty years, and yet every session
of Congress witnesses new demands for increased protection.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was Mr. Kasson who did perhaps the most effective
service against the measure. He wished simply “to foster the
incipient industries of America until they were able to take
care of themselves without help, in fair competition with the
industries of foreign countries.” To make the duties so
high that foreign competition was removed, was, in Mr.
Kasson’s judgment, to encourage monopoly. This was a
bill “to prevent the diffused blessings of Providence from
being enjoyed by the people of the United States,” he declared.
Who were the handful of wool-growers in the country
that 34,000,000 consumers should be taxed to support them?
Mr. Kasson was especially bitter against the higher prices
the bill would undoubtedly make for farmers. “What does
this bill do?” he asked. “It raises the tariff on lumber, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>is so necessary to the Western prairie farmer; on nails,
without which he cannot drive his boards on his house or
build his fence; on salt, without which he cannot preserve
his beef and pork. There is hardly a thing he consumes which
this bill forgets to raise the duty upon. Every prominent
necessity of life, food, fuel, shelter, and clothing, is embraced
and made more expensive to the consumer throughout the
country. Even on boys’ pocket-knives the duty is increased
about three times—600 per cent—one member of the
committee tells me. And yet it is said this is a tariff for
mere protection. Why, sir, you are protecting the American
people until they will not be able to buy one solitary thing
that is protected if this goes on.” It was unjust to the consumers,
and, said Mr. Kasson, “<i>Consumption represents
millions, capital only thousands.</i>”</p>

<p class='c007'>The majority of the Western representatives were with
him in the feeling that the bill was unjust to the farmer.
“Long John” Wentworth of Illinois, a Republican of Democratic
antecedents, did some sensible, pointed arguing against
the higher duties on the ground that they were against the very
men (the farmers) “who do most of the tax-paying in peace
and most of the fighting in war.” He warned emphatically
that not only was the bill a discrimination, but that it was
certain to encourage interstate combinations—a warning
which was repeatedly dropped during the debate, and to
which the tendency to combination in the salt, iron, and copper
industries gave particular force.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Wentworth and the Westerners found that there was
little chance of defeating the bill they declared that it must
be made just all around—there must be protection for the
farmer and they asked for 30 per cent on cattle, 50 per cent
on fruit, more on grain, duties which raised strong protests
from Pennsylvania and other manufacturing centres. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>would take the necessaries of life from the reach of “their
poor toiling millions.” Yes, said the Westerners, but you
are taking the necessaries of labor from <i>our</i> “poor toiling
millions.”</p>

<p class='c007'>That members of the Republican party should dare in his
presence to talk such doctrine was gall and wormwood to
Mr. Stevens, and he flung at them, and at Mr. Kasson
particularly, an epithet which in his mouth was only one
degree less opprobrious than that of “slave-holder” and
“rebel”—“free trader,” and he could prove it, for here
was Mr. Kasson’s name on one of the circulars of the Free
Trade League. Mr. Kasson did not deny the charge: “I have
the distinguished honor,” he replied, “of being a councillor-elect
to it, and I am giving my counsel to it (the League),
and to all the people of the United States.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The bill passed the House by a large majority—the high
duties on farm products which the Westerners asked tacked
to it. It was evident that Congress, as a whole, had broken
with the avowed tariff policy of the past 20 years.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the middle of July, 1866, when the bill reached the
Senate—too hot for tariffs, the Senators decided. It was
several months indeed before it came before them. Along
with it came a bill prepared by Mr. Wells, who had been
greatly disturbed by the outbreak of high protectionism.
A moderate protectionist himself—he appreciated the injustice
and the dangers in recklessly and generally increasing
duties. He had carefully studied the schedules, and he knew
how inevitably disaster must follow to some interests from
the sweeping changes proposed. He accordingly prepared
a bill much more moderate in its duties, which he claimed
would give the necessary revenue and at the same time protect
as far as was just. It met the hearty approval of the Senate,
where there had been much sarcasm spent on the House
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>bill, principally by the Republicans themselves. “The idea
has seemed to prevail of late,” said Mr. Fessenden, “that if
anybody choose to start a new manufacture by way of experiment,
thinking he can succeed in it, the duty of this
country, whatever the effect on commerce, or whatever the
taxation on individuals, is to place duties which will prevent
the importation of that article if it interferes with the manufacture
started.... Is it worth while,” he asked, “to prohibit
the importation of all articles and end our relations
with foreign countries?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Wells’s bill was made an amendment to the revised
House bill, and sent back. Mr. Morrill advised its acceptance,
and promptly. The time had come when, in his opinion,
it was “reasonable to have an unreasonable tariff.” But
there were few of the members, particularly of the Western
members, who agreed with Mr. Morrill. The bitter feeling
that the East was legislating for itself to the injury
of the farmer broke out hotly. A genuine struggle of
sections followed, to the disgust and alarm of Stevens, who
knew that if the Westerners could not or would not accept
the “home market” argument, high protection was a lost
cause. That his own side should imperil the bill was particularly
trying to him. “If the gentlemen who are in favor
of a tariff bill hold their tongues and vote,” he snarled, “letting
the other side do the talking, they may get a tariff, but
they never will if they keep up their debate.” But they
would not hold their tongues, and they did not get the bill.
In the general dissatisfaction it failed. But high protection
did not end with it. The failure to pass the bill was the signal
for a move of far-reaching consequences.</p>

<p class='c007'>The morning after the House dropped the bill Mr. John
Sherman asked the Senate to consider a measure for raising
revenue by putting up the duties on wool and woollen goods.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>There was a general outcry. Where did such a bill come from—who
had ever heard of it—how could Mr. Sherman expect
a measure plainly in the interest of a single industry to be
properly considered, when Congress was to expire “day after
to-morrow,” and more and more of the same kind, including
some caustic remarks about the influence a private industry
must have to force such a measure before the Senate at such
a time.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a matter of fact the bill now so suddenly sprung on the
Senate had been lying in wait for some seven months for
just such a contingency as the failure of the tariff bill—a
fine example of business foresight! This was its history:
In July, 1866, when the Senate postponed taking up the tariff
Judge Bingham of Ohio had brought into the House a bill
providing for higher duties on wool and woollens. It was
evidently framed to take care of the wool-growers of his
state. Certain woollen manufacturers, who had known nothing
of his intention, saw the danger of the bill antagonizing
both Congress and those manufacturers who were advocating
free wool, and persuaded Judge Bingham to allow it to be sidetracked
until the fate of the general tariff was decided. This
was done, the bill being quietly passed on to the Senate, where
nobody but Mr. Sherman seems to have known or remembered
anything about it. When the tariff bill dropped, the wool
interests immediately asked that their special measure be
presented, and Mr. Sherman agreed. Part of the dismay
that the Senate showed at the presentation of the measure
was no doubt due to its familiarity with the solid organization
and effective lobbying of the wool manufacturing interests
of that day as well as with their reputation for unsavory
lobbying in the past. It was not yet forgotten how in the
forties and fifties the wool interests had combined with the
Pennsylvania iron men to force Western representatives, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>at that time were all working for land grants for railroads,
to vote for their tariffs. The scandal of 1857 in the fight for
free raw wool was not yet forgotten. The charge of corruption
at that time had even forced a Congressional investigation
in which it was shown that one Boston wool firm had spent
some $87,000 of its own money besides some thousands of
other people’s. These sums they charged frankly on their
books “to expenses in securing the passage of the tariff of
1857.” The investigation showed that the agent of the
manufacturers confiscated most of the money intrusted to
him; that none of it, as far as shown, ever reached a Congressman,
though a considerable sum did go to editors and
“influential persons”—such was $5000 to Mr. Thurlow
Weed, for collecting statistics and using arguments!</p>

<p class='c007'>The insistent demands of the wool men, for years, had been
such, that even good Mr. Morrill had grown tired of them.
“Their evils somehow never disappear,” he said, querulously,
when he presented his bill in ’66, and he went on then to
say that never since he had been in Congress had so large a
number of petitions for help been received as had been
coming from the wool interests East and West. The wool
men, as a matter of fact, were organized then as probably
no interest in the country had ever been before. The chief
organization was the National Association of Wool Manufacturers,
having at its head as able a lobbyist and promoter
as the country has ever produced—this was John L. Hayes—a
New Englander—a graduate of Dartmouth and of the
Harvard Law School, a man of wide and varied experience.
He had been counsel for Canada when the reciprocity treaty
of 1854 was framed. He had founded iron works in Maine
and promoted a railroad in Mexico. He had been in politics.
He had held office in Washington. He was a natural scientist
of no mean order—a man versatile, knowing, engaging, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>energetic. Mr. Hayes took charge of the interests of the
wool manufactures in 1865, and he carried on a splendid
campaign for higher tariffs. The only hitch in it had been
the necessity of combining with the wool-growers. The decline
in the price of wool after the war had lead the latter
to conceive the idea that if all foreign wool could be shut out
of the country, the domestic grower would be able to monopolize
the market—at his own price. To accomplish this they
had organized to fight for a duty which they meant should be
prohibitive. The disadvantage at which the manufacturer
would find himself, should such a measure pass, was obvious,
but to fight for free wool was to antagonize a group of unusual
political power. Ohio was the chief centre of this group, but
it could count on the support of New York, Pennsylvania,
and Michigan. Mr. Hayes realized that if the wool manufacturers
should succeed in keeping their raw material free, the
wool-growers in retaliation might force low duties on woollens.
It seemed to him and to the association he directed better
policy to work with rather than against their opponents,
and largely through his influence the two conflicting interests
were brought together at a convention held in Syracuse,
New York, early in 1866. There was an attempt to convince
the sheep men that free raw wool would benefit them more
than any tariff, but they refused the argument. They must
have real protection. The two interests succeeded finally
in working out an agreement which satisfied each. The basis
of this agreement was, as afterwards stated by Commissioner
Wells, “that the duty on raw or unwashed wools and hair, other
than wools adapted for carpets, should be fixed at rates varying
from ten to twelve cents per pound, and from ten to
eleven per cent ad valorem. In order, then, to compensate
the manufacturer for such a prospective enhancement of
the price of his raw material, it was agreed that, in consideration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>of the fact that <i>four</i> pounds of the cheapest imported wool
(mestiza), paying an aggregate duty of forty-six cents, were
<i>sometimes</i> employed in the fabrication of a pound of finished
cloth, the duty on cloth should be fifty cents per pound, and
on other fabrics of wool of varying weight a duty in like
proportion. In order, next, to give the manufacturer protection
against his foreign competitors, 25 per cent ad
valorem was added; and in order to further compensate
for the payment of an internal revenue tax of 6 per cent, <i>which
tax was repealed in the succeeding year</i>, 10 per cent more was
added, thus making the aggregate duty on shawls, cloths, and
woollen goods generally, fifty cents per pound and thirty-five
per cent ad valorem. It will thus be seen that if the manufacturers,
as is often alleged, did not enter into the arrangement
for an increase in duty through their own seeking, they
nevertheless managed to secure full compensation for all that
was granted to the wool-growers; and in addition to that,
through force of subsequent circumstances, an additional
protection in excess of what, according to their showing, they
considered necessary.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was the basis of the wool schedule which had been
embodied in Mr. Morrill’s bill and also of the bill which
Mr. Sherman had sprung on the Senate. That the Senate
did not like the wool bill was evident. On all sides there
was strenuous opposition to protecting one industry and not
another, and yet the bill went through. It is worth nothing
in view of the support of the scandalous wool schedule of
1909 by both the Senators from Massachusetts, that both
Senators Summer and Wilson of Massachusetts voted
against the wool bill of 1867 and that Senators Morrill
and Fessenden absented themselves. A few hours before
the end of the session the wool bill was received by the House
and passed. But its fate was by no means decided. It still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>must have the President’s signature, and the President was
Andrew Johnson. Johnson was in poor temper to favor any
measure sanctioned by “Thad Stevens and his gang.” He had
just vetoed one of Stevens’s pet measures, and it was very
likely he would veto any bill favoring a special interest, for his
traditions and sympathies were all with a liberal commercial
policy. Mr. Hayes knew this, and he and his friends collected
outside the door of the Capitol chamber, where, as the custom
is, the President signs bills on the last night of a session.
Late in the evening it was rumored that the bill would be
vetoed. Hayes hurriedly summoned aid,—Bingham of
Ohio, the framer of the bill, the Secretary of the Treasury,
and the Attorney-General. What pressure this force brought
to bear on Mr. Johnson is unknown, but at a minute before
twelve, according to Mr. Hayes’s story, the President put
his name to the wool bill. It was a great triumph for Mr.
Hayes. “The wool bill of 1867 and its enactment into law,”
says one of the protectionist organs, “were chiefly due to his
personal influence with leading members of both branches of
Congress.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The passage of the wool bill proved that an industry, if
strongly enough organized and headed by a sufficiently able
and respectable lobbyist, could secure from the Congress of
the United States protective favors which could not be secured
for the whole mass of industries. The lesson had immediate
effect. The next year (1868) Congress was asked to pass a
similar bill, favoring the Lake Superior copper industry.
The rich mines in that section had been in operation for
several years, and in the last two or three years their output
had been increasing rapidly. As was natural, there had been
a great amount of speculation in copper mining stocks. The
public had subscribed almost as much to wildcat and bogus
copper schemes in this period as to the same kind of oil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>schemes. Probably something like $20,000,000 had been
actually invested in the region, there were forty or fifty
thousand persons settled in the district, and there was a considerable
fleet on the Lakes in the copper-carrying trade. It
was the beginning of a great industry. Now for many
years there had been in Maryland, Connecticut, and Massachusetts
copper-smelting works which used ores from Chile and
Cuba mixed with ores from the Eastern states. Since 1864
the Eastern concerns had paid a duty of 5 per cent on foreign
copper ore. The Lake Superior interests had been suffering
for several months from decreased prices, due largely
to a great increase in the world’s copper output. They had
asked relief in 1866, and a higher duty had been accorded
them in the bill that failed. They now concluded, as the wool
men had, that if they could not get what they wanted in
one way they would in another, and in July, 1868, brought
in a bill asking for a duty equal to about 25 per cent on
copper ore. It was a rate which, if granted, was bound to
put the New England and Baltimore works out of commission,
put an end to the carrying trade with Chile and Cuba, raise
the price of copper so that American-built ships could not
get their copper bottoms in our ports, and drive many industries
then using copper to cheaper substitutes, like galvanized
iron, sheet tin, zinc, or lead, and put still others to an
expense which, as they would have no compensating tariffs
to protect them, would greatly cripple them. Excited debate
followed the bill everywhere, especially in the Senate, where
Zach Chandler fought for it. The time had come, he declared,
when the manufacturers were not going to have all the protection;
miners and farmers were going to have it now. There
was not an article made in Connecticut, which was opposing
this bill, which was not protected, “not an article from a
wooden button to a brass clock or from carpetings to Jew’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>harps.” If you don’t give protection to us this way (through
special bills), we’ll take a horizontal tariff for our copper and
lumber and wheat and wool, and then if “your clocks will not
run, let them stop.” His picture of the suffering of the miners
following the closing of the mines no doubt won many to
the measure. It was because of that, said Mr. Morrill,
that he should vote for it, though he believed it would help
speculation in copper stocks more than the suffering miners of
Michigan, and that it was a blow to ship-building and commerce.
Would it not be better, suggested Mr. Grimes of
Iowa, to organize a branch of the Freedman’s Bureau and
send it to Michigan to take care of the miners?</p>

<p class='c007'>The bill finally passed and by large majorities, and in
February, 1869, went to President Johnson. Whatever the
influences which had induced Johnson to sign a bill which
must have been so repugnant to him as the wool bill, there was
little chance that they would have any effect upon him now.
His term was almost over. In a few days he was to yield
the White House to “that little fellow Grant,” as he called
him, and go back to his Tennessee home to hoe potatoes and
discuss politics with his neighbors in his son-in-law’s village
store.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was going out in a sense victorious, for he had not been
convicted, and his arch-enemy Stevens was dead, and yet it
is doubtful if the end of his terrific fight with Congress gave
him much happiness, if indeed anything could give him real
happiness. Certainly Johnson suffered throughout his four
years as President as few people at the time realized. One
of his secretaries once said that in the two years he was with
him in the White House he never saw him smile but once. Ill
himself, his beloved wife a bed-ridden invalid, unfitted for
companionship, suspicious of his associates, narrow in mind,
bitter and resentful in heart, there was little reason indeed why
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Andrew Johnson should smile. Yet unquestionably he got
a grim pleasure from his vetoes, even out of his impeachment
trial. He believed he would be convicted, and his secretary
tells of the satisfaction he got from the idea that his persecutors
would all come to bad ends. He learned Addison’s Cato
by heart, and went about the White House rooms delivering
it. He studied the trial of Charles I of England, and ordered
the names of those who signed the death warrant and the
terrible ends to which they all came tabulated. His secretary
says he believes Johnson was not a little disappointed when he
was acquitted. It took from him the bitterest of the many
bitter cuds he incessantly chewed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Throughout his administration Johnson had fought with
little effect the horde of lobbyists, speculators, land grant
agents, and other suppliants for government aid, whom the
war had brought together and Congress had rather encouraged
than discouraged. The bills granting tariffs to special interests
belonged to this category unquestionably, however
respectable their supporters, and it was to be expected that
Johnson would veto the copper bill, and he did, sending with
his veto the following message—not his own, however.
The letter was written by Mr. Wells.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c013'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Feb. 23, 1869.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><i>To the House of Representatives</i>: The accompanying bill,
entitled “An Act regulating the duties on imported copper
and copper ores,” is, for the following reasons, returned, without
my approval, to the House of Representatives, in which
branch of Congress it originated.</p>

<p class='c014'>Its immediate effect will be to diminish the public receipts,
for the object of the bill cannot be accomplished without
seriously affecting the importation of copper and copper ores,
from which a considerable revenue is at present derived.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>While thus impairing the resources of the government, it
imposes an additional tax upon an already overburdened
people, who should not be further impoverished that monopolies
may be fostered and corporations enriched.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is represented, and the declaration seems to be sustained
by evidence, that the duties for which this bill provides are
nearly or quite sufficient to prohibit the importation of
certain foreign ores of copper. Its enactments, therefore, will
prove detrimental to the shipping interests of the nation, and
at the same time destroy the business, for many years successively
established, of smelting home ores in connection with a
smaller amount of the imported articles. This business, it is
credibly asserted, has heretofore yielded the larger share of
the copper production of the country, and thus the industry
which this legislation is designed to encourage is actually less
than that which will be destroyed by the passage of the bill.</p>

<p class='c014'>It seems also to be evident that the effect of this measure
will be to enhance by 70 per cent the cost of blue vitriol—an
article extensively used in dyeing and in the manufacture
of printed and colored cloths. To produce such an augmentation
in the price of this commodity will be to discriminate
against other great branches of domestic industry, and by
increasing their cost expose them most unfairly to the effects
of foreign competition. Legislation can be neither wise nor
just which seeks the welfare of a single interest at the expense
and to the injury of many and varied interests at least equally
important and equally deserving the consideration of Congress.</p>

<p class='c014'>The enactment of such a law is urged as necessary for the
relief of certain mining interests upon Lake Superior, which,
it is alleged, are in a greatly depressed condition, and can
only be sustained by an enhancement of the price of copper.
If this result should follow the passage of the bill, a tax for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>exclusive benefit of a single class would be imposed upon the
consumers of copper throughout the entire country not warranted
by any need of the government, and the avails of which
would not in any degree find their way into the treasury of the
nation. If the miners of Lake Superior are in a condition of
want, it cannot be justly affirmed that the government should
extend charity to them in preference to those of its citizens
who in other portions of the country suffer in like manner from
destitution. Least of all should endeavor to aid them be
based upon a method so uncertain and indirect as that contemplated
by the bill, and which, moreover, proposes to
continue the exercise of its benefactions through an indefinite
period of years. It is, besides, reasonable to hope that
positive suffering from want, if it really exists, will prove
but temporary in a region where agricultural labor is so
much in demand and so well compensated. A careful examination
of the subject appears to show that the present low
price of copper, which alone has induced any depression the
mining interests of Lake Superior may have recently experienced,
is due to causes which it is wholly unpolitic, if not impracticable,
to contravene by legislation. These causes are
in the main an increase in the general supply of copper, owing
to the discovery and working of remarkably productive
mines and to a coincident restriction in the consumption and
use of copper by the substitution of other and cheaper metals
for industrial purposes.</p>

<p class='c014'>Although providing for an increase of duties, the proposed
law does not even come within the range of protection in the
fair acceptance of the term. It does not look to the fostering
of a young and feeble interest, with a view to the ultimate
attainment of strength and the capacity of self-support. It
appears to assume that the present inability for successful
production is inherent and permanent, and is more likely to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>increase than to be gradually overcome; yet in spite of this it
proposes by the exercise of the law-making power to sustain
that interest and to impose it in hopeless perpetuity as a tax
upon the competent and beneficent industries of the country.</p>

<p class='c014'>The true method for the mining interests of Lake Superior
to obtain relief, if relief is needed, is to endeavor to make
their great natural resources fully available by reducing the
cost of production. Special or class legislation cannot
remedy the evils which this bill is designed to meet. They
can only be overcome by laws which will effect a wise, honest,
and economical administration of the government, a reestablishment
of the special standard of values and an
early adjustment of our system of state, municipal, and
national taxation (especially the latter) upon the fundamental
principle that all taxes, whether collected under the internal
revenue or under a tariff, shall interfere as little as possible
with the productive energies of the people.</p>

<p class='c014'>The bill is therefore returned, in the belief that the true
interest of the government and of the people require it should
not become a law.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c015'>

      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Andrew Johnson.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Of course Congress passed the bill over Johnson’s veto.
Mr. Pike of Maine, who regarded the bill as “class legislation
of the worst kind,” and knew the feeling that one of the
President’s vetoes inspired, begged his colleagues “to vote
on the measure and not on Andrew Johnson,” but no remonstrance
or argument had any effect. The bill was passed
over the veto by a large majority.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was again demonstrated that any private interest which
could secure the backing of a powerful Senator or Representative
like Sherman of Ohio, Chandler of Michigan, Kelley of
Pennsylvania, could obtain what it wanted from the Congress
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>of the United States, though that favor might raise prices
to consumers without giving them compensation in other
directions, might destroy established industries, and injure
an established commerce.</p>

<p class='c007'>The demonstration was not lost. By 1870 the tariff was a
conglomeration of special favors. The duties were not for
revenue—many of them, like copper, cut down the revenue.
They had no relation any longer to the excise, for while that
had been steadily decreased the promise to decrease the tariff
at the same time had been broken. The duties had no relation
to each other; that is, the cost of manufacturing an article
might be materially increased by the duty on copper or iron
or soda ash, but it received no compensating help—not until
it had organized a lobby and laid siege to Congress.</p>

<p class='c007'>These unjust and unscientific duties had not been laid without
protest. Men like Morrill, Garfield, Fessenden, Allison,
Kasson, Raymond, and Sumner had warned against the outbreak.
“It smells of monopoly,” they said again and again,
and yet most of them when it came to the test voted with
their party. Many of the ablest Republican newspapers,
especially those in the West, harangued incessantly against
the unfairness of the legislation. But remonstrance, even
an attempt at discussion, only aroused the angry cry of “free-trader”
from the dominant faction in Congress. “It has
become impossible,” said Mr. Wells, in his report of December,
1869, for one “to suggest any reduction or modification
whatever looking to the abatement of prices artificially
maintained in the interest of special industries without being
immoderately assailed with accusations of corrupt and unpatriotic
motives.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The tariff legislation was but a part of the deplorable and
general attempt which followed the war to make Congress
do for the individual what it was his business to do for himself.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Men seemed to believe that their futures depended on legislation—to
have forgotten or never realized that legislation
can do nothing more than distribute wealth—it cannot produce
it, and that the only way you can get money to legislate
into the pocket of one individual is by taking it out of the
pocket of another. Washington had come to be filled with as
fine a band of plunderers as ever besieged a National Congress:
tax swindlers, smugglers, speculators in land grants, railroad
lobbyists, agents of ship companies, mingled with the representatives
of industries seeking protection, until it seemed as
if Congress was little more than a Relief Bureau. At one
time in 1869 there were 41 railroads or would-be railroads
seeking aid in the House, and 37 in the Senate. What was to
be the effect of this outbreak of protectionism? Many sober
people asked themselves the question in dismay. But at the
moment everybody was looking to Grant. The new President
would certainly help the situation—bring back Congress and
the party to candid discussion, institute economies, clear
Washington of the self-seekers.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III<br /> <span class='large'>THE WAR TARIFFS CONTINUED</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Whatever hope moderate protectionists in Congress may
have had that the new President would be influenced by
their arguments in favor of tariff reform, was soon scattered.
General Grant was of uncertain political antecedents. It is
doubtful if he ever had any particular interest in the tariff
question, and it is certain that he did not at that moment
consider it a question for his administration to meddle with.
In his first message he advised postponement of revision and
against the renewal of the reciprocity treaty between the
British Provinces and the United States. The one financial
duty which he saw at his inauguration was the resumption
of specie payment, and on that his voice was firm.</p>

<p class='c007'>But even more important than the attitude of the new
President on the tariff was the attitude of the new leader of
the House. Who that would be was still uncertain. Thaddeus
Stevens, who for fully eight years had driven the House
like a flock of sheep, had died in August, 1868. There is no
doubt that a sigh of relief went up from all the younger element
in Congress. “The death of Thaddeus Stevens is the
emancipation of the Republicans. He kept the party under his
heel,” said James G. Blaine one day soon after, as he walked in
the rotunda of the Capitol with a friend. “Whom have you got
for leaders?” asked the friend. “There are three young men
coming forward,” Blaine replied. “Allison will be heard
from, so will James A. Garfield,” and then he paused. “Who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>is the third?” “I don’t see the third,” Blaine replied, gazing
up into the dome. The third appeared a little later when Mr.
Blaine was elected Speaker of the Forty-first Congress.</p>

<p class='c007'>Blaine’s attitude on the tariff was well known. He believed
in high protection, but he was a politician before he was an
advocate, and could be depended upon to give full hearing to
anybody in his party who could muster votes. That he did
not consider the tariff reformers strong enough to receive
much consideration on the Ways and Means Committee was
shown by his appointment of the chairman—Robert C.
Schenck of Ohio. General Schenck’s tariff position had
been well characterized by himself when the bill of 1866 was
up. “Sitting here a friend of protective tariff for eight years,”
he said, “<i>I have voted aye or nay as those who got up the tariff
bills have told me.</i>” “But,” he went on to say, “we begin to
find something like fair play is proper in these things: We
claim that what we do and can produce shall have the same
protection which is given to the industry of the country,
applied to the business of manufacturers.” And henceforth
Mr. Schenck worked for duties for the farmer, for anybody
in fact that asked one. It is clear that the House thus organized
could be depended upon to support the doctrine of high
protection.</p>

<p class='c007'>The vitality of the opposition within the party made itself
evident, however, almost at once. Republican district
conventions, particularly in the West, showed themselves
restive, and at Mansfield, Ohio, in June, 1869, General Roeliff
Brinkerhoff actually succeeded in getting into a Republican
platform the following resolution:</p>

<p class='c012'>“<i>Resolved</i>, That we are opposed to all class legislation, government
subsidies and grinding monopolies of every kind, and, therefore,
we heartily favor a revision of the present oppressive tariff, so
as to adjust it purely to a revenue standard.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>The way the press took up General Brinkerhoff’s resolution
showed how popular his theory was. Murat Halstead published
in full the speech the General had made in presenting
the resolution—and it was copied and commented on all over
the country. The Free Trade League of New York City, a
very energetic organization, sent for the General, and with
him planned a lecture campaign. This plan was carried out;
General Brinkerhoff and Professor Arthur L. Perry, of
Williams College, the author of a book generally used at the
time, “Elements of Political Economy,” spending much of the
fall and winter in discussing the need of tariff reform. At the
same time a group of strong Republican newspapers, including
the Portland <cite>Advertiser</cite>, the St. Louis <cite>Democrat</cite>, the Pittsburg
<cite>Commercial</cite>, the Cincinnati <cite>Gazette</cite>, and the Chicago <cite>Tribune</cite>,
one of the very ablest papers in the country, turned their batteries
on the tariff. The last-named led in the campaign and
led well. The <cite>Tribune</cite> was edited, at that time, by Horace
White, and under his direction had attracted general attention
and respect for its sound and authoritative economic discussion.
Mr. White was a zealous student of economics, and he
poured into the <cite>Tribune</cite> all the results of his careful work.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chief opponents of Perry and Brinkerhoff and White
in the discussion, were Horace Greeley and Henry C. Carey.
Greeley was an extremist. “If I had my way—if I were king
of this country,” he told Garfield once, “I would put a duty of
$100 a ton on pig-iron and a proportionate duty on everything
else that can be produced in America. The result would
be that our people would be obliged to supply their own wants,
manufactures would spring up, competition would finally reduce
prices, and we should live wholly within ourselves.”
And to prove the wisdom of this belief he began the publication
in the New York <cite>Tribune</cite> of a series of Essays on Political
Economy.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>At the same time Henry Carey threw himself into the debate,
writing a long series of letters to public men. Carey was at
this time over 75 years old—and a more fierce and dogmatic
championship of a cause could not be conceived than his of
high protection and of paper money. Originally a free-trader
Carey had early concluded that society was too undeveloped
to practise it, and that a long period of protection
must precede. His views on social and economic subjects
he had elaborated in many volumes, the first of which had been
published in 1835. The chief of his works are his “Principles
of Political Economy” and his “Principles of Social Science.”
Both of these have been translated into a half dozen European
languages, and they certainly must be reckoned with largely
in tracing the influences which have made for protection in
our time. Carey in spite of all his hard labor saw the people
recede from his views in 1846, and the return to protection in
1860 had given him unbounded joy. He wrote Morrill
frequent letters of counsel and instruction when he was at
work on the bill of 1861, urging him always to more arbitrary
action than his just and reasonable mind relished. “Nothing
less than a dictator is required for making a really good
tariff,” Carey once said to him. So convinced was he of his position,
so sure that he had solved finally the economic problem
that any discussion or criticism spurred him to the most intolerant
opposition. After Richard Cobden’s death in 1865,
Carey said in a public gathering in Philadelphia that he regarded
it as one of those instances of special providence for
which the United States had especial reason to be thankful;
for, said Carey, it was the intention of Mr. Cobden if he had
lived to have again visited the United States; if he had done
so he might have lectured, and so have done great harm to
the cause of protection.</p>

<p class='c007'>David Wells was a particular abomination to Carey. His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>reports pointing out the unjust discrimination caused by
certain tariffs, and the fact that wages were not increasing in
the ratio of expenses Carey charged to be untrue—juggling
of figures paid for with “British gold.” One of his pamphlets
answering Wells he headed with this quotation from the New
Testament: <i>Then one of the twelve called Judas Iscariot
went unto the chief priests and said unto them “what will ye
give me, and I will deliver him unto you?” And they covenanted
with him for thirty pieces of silver and from that time he
sought opportunity to betray him ... and forthwith he came
to Jesus and said “Hail Master,” and kissed him.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>As a matter of fact Wells was doing serious injury to the
schedules then in force by pointing out what they were and
were not doing. For instance there was the wool bill of 1867.
It had been in operation for nearly two years, and according to
Mr. Wells wool was in a more depressed state than before its
passage. His summary of conditions was startling:</p>

<p class='c007'>1st. Wool to the agriculturalist at a lower price in gold
than has almost ever before been experienced.</p>

<p class='c007'>2d. A decrease in the number of sheep in the United
States, estimated by the Commissioner of Agriculture at four
millions for the single year of 1868, while other authorities
place the total decrease as high as 25 per cent since the passage
of the wool tariff.</p>

<p class='c007'>3d. A condition of the woollen manufacture characterized
by a greater depression than that of any other branch of
industry in the country, with the exception of ship-building;
small profit accruing to a few, heavy losses to the many, with
numerous and constantly recurring failures.</p>

<p class='c007'>4th. An increase in the importations of foreign fabrics
of wool; the imports of the fiscal year 1868 being returned
at $32,458,884, and for 1869 at $34,620,943.</p>

<p class='c007'>5th. Encouragement of smuggling and its apparent reduction
to a system.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>“In short,” concluded Mr. Wells after a full discussion of
these points, “what is now needed to restore prosperity to
the woollen industry, is a removal of all duties on the importation
of foreign wools and dyestuffs, and a general reduction of
the duties on manufactured woollen fabrics of every description
to 25 per cent ad valorem. On this basis the most
experienced woollen manufacturers in the country assure the
commissioner that they can at once extend, diversify, and
secure prosperity in their business. On this basis the cost
of domestic fabrics will be so far reduced as to give great
relief to the consumer, and lead to an immediate and largely
increased consumption. And on this basis only can the wool-growers
expect any immediate increased demand for his staple
product of merino fleece; while in respect to the combing
and the finer wools it is sufficient to say that the supply of
these wools has not for the last few years increased in proportion
to their consumption, and that the extension of their use
in the American industry, which would inevitably follow a
remission of the duties upon their import, would so far increase
their demand as to give to the domestic producer all the encouragement
that would prove necessary.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the many cases which Mr. Wells analyzed in his
reports none excited more interest than that of salt. Salt was
so widely diffused in the United States, and its production in
various sections had been so cheap and simple, that the price
before the war was very low. The efforts of the states where
it was found, particularly of New York State, had always
been to keep it abundant and cheap. But so many persons
had gone into the business in that state that there had been at
times over-production and serious price-cutting, and as early
as 1860 the New York salt men formed a company to put a
stop to this sort of thing. By a clever manipulation of the
State Assembly, which was the guardian of the salt-wells,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>they secured a law which permitted them to prevent the starting
of any new salt-works. They then went to work to get
control by buying or leasing all existing works. Succeeding
in this they promptly shut down many of them and began to
limit the output. The next year after the combination was
formed came on the war, and the tariff on salt was raised
to 12 cents a bushel (it had been 1½ cents in 1857). A
year later it was raised to 18 cents, a duty equivalent to from
100 to 150 per cent of its value. This high rate practically
put an end to foreign competition, and the exigencies of war
taking the salt of Virginia and Louisiana out of the market,
the Northern works had things pretty much their own way.
Salt, which had sold at 20 cents a bushel in 1860, was selling
five years later at 66 cents, and in 1869 at 48.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Syracuse company made extraordinary profits under
these circumstances. In 1861, the year after their first
combination, 7 per cent. In 1862 they paid <i>six</i> dividends,
one of them 12½ per cent. They soon issued a stock dividend
of 100 per cent, and paid the same large cash dividends on
this. In the first six years after the combination was formed
it paid out $2,000,000 in dividends on a paid up capital of
$160,000, and had a surplus of $600,000 on hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meantime the Michigan salt-works were growing
rapidly. Their output which in 1860 had been but 4000
barrels became over a half million in 1864! But the same
thing happened there as in Syracuse—too many companies.
Sixty-six were operating there by 1866, and combination was
applied, and the Michigan companies were soon consolidated
into two. But the end of the war loosened the Southern works
and competition was in danger of being restored. The New
York and Michigan companies hastened to prevent such a
disaster. They entered into negotiations with the Ohio
River Company to limit the output, and the latter to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>itself firmer leased the Kanawha, Virginia, Salt Springs for
$75,000 a year and shut them down. Simultaneously with
this campaign for making salt scarce at home, the industry
began one to make it still dearer, an agitation for more duty—18
and 24 cents a hundred pounds were not enough, they
wanted 30 and 42 cents, and this in spite of the fact that the
internal revenue tax had been removed from salt. If the
copper and wool men could get special bills through, why
not they? There seemed no good reason to the House of
Representatives—and they actually passed the measure—though
the Senate did not concur, for lack of time, and the
bill never became a law.</p>

<p class='c007'>This interesting combination had not only succeeded
through the tariff in making salt scarce and dear, but they
had, as all such combinations do, given the lie to their claim
that they could not produce it at a cost which would enable
them to sell it cheaper, by exporting in 1868 some 500,000
bushels, which they had sold in competition with foreign salt,
and by offering the New England fishermen who were allowed
to import salt without duty, prices as low as those abroad;
that is, they had one price for the land and another for the
sea, one for Canada and another for the United States.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Wells’s evidence on the salt monopoly was complete—it
had made a necessity of life dear through a tariff much
higher than the internal tax and the higher wage of American
labor called for. The greater part of the extra price the consumers
were paying was going not into the pockets of the
laborers, but into those of the operators.</p>

<p class='c007'>After salt the portion of the reports which attracted the
most attention dealt with the tariff on iron. Pig-iron was
still enjoying the protection of $9.00 a ton, given it in the
spring of 1865, and this, though practically all internal revenue
taxes on it had been removed. Its price had risen from $22.70
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>a ton in  1860 to an average in 1869 of $40.61. The cost of
producing this iron in the United States, including interest,
repairs, and incidentals, was from $24.00 to $26.00 a ton, and
it could be bought in England at $27.12. Mr. Wells’s conclusion,
after examining all the elements in the problem, was
that the cost of pig-iron to the American consumers was from
$8.00 to $10.00 per ton more than was necessary to pay the
American laborer his higher wage, and give the American
manufacturer a fair profit; that is, the iron men were receiving
a bonus of from $8.00 to $10.00 a ton from the country.
Of course, this high price of pig-iron affected the cost of
production in all sorts of industries. The most telling illustration
of its effect was that of ship-building. The year the
Civil War broke out the tonnage of the merchant marine
of the United States was 5,539,813. Twice as many American
vessels entered British ports as British entered American
ports. The <i>American Clipper</i> was famous all seas over. We
were building vessels for the foreigners, and everybody was
quoting with pride a remark of John Bright in the House of
Commons that the finest vessels sailing between England and
Australia were built in the United States. Iron vessels were
at this time beginning to replace wooden. England had taken
the lead in their building, but we were beginning the industry,
and our success in all related industries made it certain that
we should succeed here. The war, of course, interrupted trade
sadly. But the alarming thing was, that the war over, there
was no recovery of the loss. On the contrary, it increased.
In 1869 the tonnage had fallen to 4,246,507. Instead of
American vessels filling British ports, British filled ours.
A trade between the United States and Brazil carried on
in 1860 in 345 American and 178 foreign vessels was almost
exactly reversed. Shipyards all along the coast were shutting
down. Why was it? The ship-builders did not hesitate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>to say: “The day of the iron ship has come, but it cannot
be built in America. The ship that costs $88,000 in Scotland,
costs $138,000 here.” It is not the superior cost of labor
the ship-builders contended. The advantage the Scotch
and English ship-builders have in cheap labor is compensated
for with us by superior efficiency and by labor-saving
devices. It is the cost of materials that cripples us.
Just as the increased cost of copper, through a high duty,
had put an end to copper bottoming and repairing of wooden
ships in American ports, so the high tariff on iron and lumber
was putting an end to ship-building.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Wells included many other similar illustrations in
his report, but it was wool, salt, iron, and ship-building which
demonstrated his points most clearly: that tariffs, which were
so high that they were practically prohibitive, as in these
cases, could not restore a depressed industry, they raised
prices unnaturally high to the consumer, gave unnatural
profits to the few manufacturers as in the case of pig-iron,
led inevitably to monopolies as in the case of salt, and destroyed
related industries as in the case of ship-building.</p>

<p class='c007'>The report created a great noise and played a big part
in the debate on the tariff bill, which General Schenck introduced
into the House in February, 1870. That any bill
attempted at this juncture should follow the pledges the
leaders had given in ’62 and ’64 to reduce the tariffs as the
internal taxes were reduced, would seem evident. But there
was no proof that General Schenck and his committee had
given more than a passing glance at these pledges. That the
tariffs, whose unjust and dangerous excess had been demonstrated,
should be corrected, seemed evident—but they were
either ignored or only partially readjusted. Thus pig-iron,
which undoubtedly would have been amply protected by a
duty of $3.00 a ton, was allowed $7.00. The revenue was reduced,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>as it was imperative it should be, by lowering the duties
on sugar, tea, and coffee—a “free breakfast table” being the
committee’s slogan. An animated wrangle followed the introduction
of the bill. The leaders on the extreme wings
were William D. Kelley of Pennsylvania for the high protectionists,
and S. S. Cox of New York for the free traders; while
Messrs. Allison of Iowa and Garfield of Ohio led the moderates.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Kelley was at this time at the height of his power, and
a more passionate and convinced supporter of the doctrine
of protection has never sat in the Congress of the United
States. He had not always been a protectionist. “In 1847,”
he wrote once, “I had seen with gratification the protective
tariff of 1842 succeeded by the revenue or free-trade tariff
of 1846. To promote this change I had labored not only with
zeal and industry, but with undoubting faith that experience
would prove its benefits. For ten years all went well, and
then came the panic of 1857.” To Mr. Kelley it was a knockout
blow. He seems not to have considered the natural
causes of the disturbance, but to have concluded the trouble
lay entirely in the tariff, and for two years he went through
the agony of a man losing his faith. Then in 1859 he sought
Henry C. Carey for help. His conversion to protection was
complete. As he himself said he came to regard the doctrine
as an “exquisite harmony.” Everything which we could
produce or manufacture should be so protected that the
foreigner could not enter the market. By diversifying and
expanding our industries we would draw greater and greater
numbers to our country, thus giving larger and larger markets
to our farmers. The manufacturers were to supply all the
tools of the farmers and miners.<a id='t63'></a> Encouraged by
prosperity production would multiply, and competition would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>reduce prices at home lower than abroad. It was a perfect
circle.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no doubt that the basis of Kelley’s devotion to protection
was his belief that it was for the interest of the American
working classes. The improvement of their condition
was the passion of his life. Apprenticed as a boy to a Boston
printer he had refused to be sent to college lest it might wean
him from his class. He wanted to taste with them all the
experiences of poverty—to know what it cost for a day laborer
to live and rise in America. He had studied law at night,
had sought the society of Channing and Emerson, had
become a man of influence, but his motive had remained unchanged.
The misery he saw in 1857 he charged entirely to
the free-trade system. He could not rest until he had found
a substitute. He believed he had found it in the “exquisite
harmony” of protection.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having adopted a formula he believed competent to solve
all problems, Kelley could support no criticism of its operations.
Mr. Wells’s demonstration that high tariffs had
not restored wool to its old vigor, had been the determining
factor in building up the salt monopoly, that the iron men
were getting the lion’s share of the duty on iron, that we could
not build ships if we kept the price of materials so much
higher than in other countries, was to him little better than
blasphemy. Wells became his pet abomination—a detestation
soon after extended to Professor Sumner of Yale,
a man and an institution existing, he used to say angrily, for
“the stupefaction of the youth of this country!”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the debate on the Schenck Bill Mr. Kelley’s defence of
the high tariffs was impassioned and angry. Monopoly,
what did he care for monopoly, he cried, when Mr. Allison
called his attention to the fact that a certain iron manufacturer
whose scale of wages Kelley was praising, had, with the only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>three other of his kind in the country, agreed upon a list of
prices made by adding to the price abroad the duty and a
profit on the cost at home. “I do not care what they agreed
to do if they are thereby enabling workingmen to keep their
children at school, well-fed and comfortably clad, to maintain
their seats in church and to lay something up for old age and
a rainy day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Kelley’s refusal to consider any argument for lowering
duties, particularly on iron, led to a charge that he was in
the pay of the iron manufacturers. No proof of this accusation
was ever offered. The New York <cite>Nation</cite>, which repeated it
in 1872, made the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amende honorable</span></i> soon after, saying that
Mr. Kelley and his friends had convinced them that he had
no interest which would justify this charge. Kelley’s case
was different from that of Thaddeus Stevens, who did own an
iron foundry. The cause of the charge was due no doubt to
Kelley’s unwillingness to admit that there could be evils in
applying his favorite doctrine. For corruption <i>outside</i> of the
tariff he had a just indignation—as for the whiskey frauds.
He looked with horror on Simon Cameron; and in 1872, when
office-seeking was causing great scandal, he refused to accept
renomination to Congress, except on condition that hereafter
he should not be regarded as a “patronage broker.” His
defeat was generally prophesied, but he kept his word and
won.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the other end of the scale from Kelley was Samuel
Sullivan Cox, by far the most eloquent, witty, and well-informed
debater the Democrats had. Cox was an uncompromising
free-trader, and one of the most interesting figures
in Congress. He was still a young man, forty-four at this
time, but an experienced one. A graduate of Brown, he had
first taken part in public life as the editor of the <cite>Statesman</cite>
of Columbus, Ohio. Here at the very start he earned his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>sobriquet of “Sunset Cox” by an editorial, which went all
over the country; “A Great Old Sunset,” it was called. It
opened, “What a stormful sunset was that of last night!
How glorious the storm, and how splendid the setting of the
sun.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His popularity sent him to Congress in 1857, where, although
a Democrat, he immediately put himself in opposition
to the Buchanan administration by voting against the Lecompton
Constitution. In 1866 he removed to New York
City, which promptly sent him back to Congress as one of its
representatives. The spirit and wit Cox could infuse into a
tariff debate can only be understood by reading the <cite>Congressional
Record</cite>. His irreverent interpretations of extreme
protectionism kept poor Mr. Kelley in a constant tumult.
Kelley’s sense of humor, which seems not to have been strong
at any time, was utterly swamped by the serious view he took
of his favorite doctrine, and Cox gibed him unmercifully.
“Pig-Iron Kelley” he called him, and his resolutions “pig-iron
resolutions.” Perhaps his most successful sally at his
opponents in this Congress was his resolution against free
sunshine—a resolution adapted from Bastiat—made when
there was a fight on against lowering the duty on coal:</p>

<p class='c012'>“<i>Resolved</i>, That all windows, skylights, inside and outside
shutters, curtains and blinds shall be permanently closed, as also
all openings, holes, chinks, clefts, and fissures through which the light
and heat of the sun have been allowed to enter houses to the prejudice
and injury of meritorious miners and dealers in gas-coal
to protect domestic industry.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“For the sun is a ‘foreigner,’” explained Mr. Cox. “He
comes from abroad, and we must shut out the light of the sun
in order to gratify these Pennsylvania gentlemen who have
a monopoly of this article of coal.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>The real fight on the Schenck Bill was not, as already said,
between Republicans and Democrats; it was as it had been
in 1866 and 1867, in the party, between Mr. Kelley and his
friends and the moderate protectionists, led by Allison and
Garfield. Almost without exception the speakers on this
middle ground opened by disclaiming that it was a question of
protection or of free trade. It was a question of revenue, of
moderate temporary protection, and of keeping promises made
in the war. And nearly all of them having thus defined
their positions attacked the bill, because it did not summarily
cut down the tariffs on salt, iron, leather, coal, lumber, and
other articles, where it could be conclusively shown that they
were working chiefly for the benefit of the few.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Allison, who was particularly hard on the excessive
duty on iron, wanted a reduction of at least 20 per cent on
all leading articles. He knew he differed from the majority
of the Ways and Means Committee on this, he said, but—</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is not a question of political partnership. It is a question
of affecting every interest in this country and every class, and because
of the great interests involved should receive careful consideration
at our hands irrespective of partisanship.... I warn those
who insist so pertinaciously upon a retention of these high duties
upon necessary articles of consumption that they only hasten the
time when a more radical change will be made in our tariff laws.
What manufacturers need most of all is stability in legislation,
avoiding sudden and sweeping changes. The changes which I
have proposed would reduce the revenue only a few million dollars,
while to the consumers of manufactures produced they would
reduce the cost of those products many million dollars. In my
judgment such a policy would revive many industries now languishing,
and not interfere with the great industries already
established, and which under any change we are likely to make will
still be largely protected. Our policy should be so to cheapen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>manufactured products that we can revive our export trade, now
swept away, because we cannot compete with other nations in
the markets of the world. If we could restore what we have lost,
and in addition greatly enlarge our exportations of manufactures,
we should then have an enlarged home market for our agricultural
products, which would then be exported in a concentrated form in
exchange for other commodities which we do not now and cannot
produce.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The debate on the bill occupied the House much of the time
from the middle of March until the 6th of June, when it was
passed. The Senate took it up at once, and the debate there
followed very much the same lines as in the House:—protestation
that it was not an academic question—pleas from
Mr. Morrill and his friends to remember the war time pledges—warnings
against the “smell of monopoly”—plans for
removing the causes of the decline of ship-building. In short,
the Republicans themselves rehearsed fully and forcibly the
injustice in certain tariffs then in force, and asked the party
to correct them. All of the correction they got was $2.00 a
ton off pig-iron. Salt, leather, lumber, wool, copper, and other
articles were not touched. The relief demanded for the consumer
came in the breakfast table. Thus the bill, which
the President signed on July 14, reduced the duties on tea
about 40 per cent; on coffee, 40 per cent; on sugar of
the lower grades, 33⅓ per cent; on clarified sugars, 21<span class='fraction'>3<br /><span class='vincula'>7</span></span> and
12½ per cent; on spices from 33⅓ to 75 per cent. On
brandy the reduction was $3.00 to $2.00 per gallon, or 33⅓
per cent; on spirits from grain, 20 per cent. The free list
was largely increased, certain important materials for manufacturing,
ivory, India rubber, and rags for paper making,
being included in a far greater number of unimportant items.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Kelley and his sympathizers had saved the doctrine
of high protection, and they accompanied their victory by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>a manœuvre which they evidently hoped would preserve
them in the future from the necessity of considering such
troublesome arrays of facts about the effects of particular
tariffs as those forced upon them in the last four years by Mr.
Wells’s reports. They persuaded the President to refuse
to continue the office of special commissioner of revenue, which
Mr. Wells had filled since his appointment by President
Lincoln in March, 1865. The majority of Congress deeply
deplored this move, and joined in signing a letter to him expressing
their appreciation of his services. The wise men of
the party realized only too well how they would be crippled
without Mr. Wells. It was a loss which time has only intensified.
It is not too much to say, that if he had continued
to study and expound officially the revenue system for the next
twenty years with the same dispassionate thoroughness and
clearness that characterized the five years’ work he did do,
the problem of the equitable distribution of wealth in this
country would be much nearer an intelligent solution than
it is to-day.</p>

<p class='c007'>The passage of the Schenck Bill and the removal of Mr.
Wells only intensified the sentiment of the tariff reformers.
A most interesting movement had sprung up in that
year (1870) in Missouri. It was a new organization, called
the Liberal party, headed by Colonel William M. Grosvenor,
the editor of the St. Louis <cite>Democrat</cite>, Carl Schurz, United
States Senator from Missouri, and Gustavus Finkelnburg, a
Representative from that State. The Liberal Republicans
asked for several things which they felt they were not getting
under Grant: general amnesty, revenue reforms, resumption
of specie payment, and civil service reform. They had put up
a ticket in Missouri, and elected it. Sympathy with their
aims was widely diffused, and all over the country Republican
conventions began to put tariff planks into their platforms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>similar to theirs, or to the one General Brinkerhoff had slipped
into the Ohio platform in 1869, while party organs, like the
Portland (Me.) <cite>Advertiser</cite>, the Chicago <cite>Tribune</cite>, the St. Louis
<cite>Democrat</cite>, redoubled their efforts. In the fall the Free Trade
League again sent out General Brinkerhoff and Professor
Perry on a lecture tour. General Brinkerhoff made a stir
with a lecture, which he called “The Tyrants of Syracuse.”
It was a scientific dissection of the Salt Trust, which surpassed
in completeness and convincingness anything which had been
achieved in any one of the many analyses which had been
given in Congress. The cumulative effect of the agitation
began to stir the rulers of Congress, particularly Mr. Blaine,
who was a candidate for re-election as Speaker. Unless he
could make a compromise with the tariff reformers he saw
there was danger of their uniting with the Democrats and
thereby defeating him. He went to Chicago and sought Horace
White “for the sole purpose of talking over the situation.”
A little later he asked the four whom he evidently considered
the most influential in the movement to meet him secretly in
New York. The four were William B. Allison, Horace White,
Charles Nordhoff, and General Brinkerhoff. There was a long
discussion, ending in a proposition from Mr. Blaine that if
the reformers would permit him to be re-elected Speaker he
would permit them to name the chairman of the Ways and
Means Committee, and give them a majority on it of their
way of thinking. The proposition was accepted, and Mr.
Blaine was asked to appoint Mr. Garfield.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no reason to suppose that Mr. Blaine would not
keep his promise, nevertheless the suspicion that he was
“slippery” in politics was not uncommon, and the Free Trade
League concluded to send General Brinkerhoff to Washington
to see that the arrangement was carried out.</p>

<p class='c007'>The new Congress—the Forty-second—opened on March
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>4, 1871. General Brinkerhoff had made a careful study of
the tariff record of the members of the new House and felt
sure of a majority, but it was resolved to test the tariff sentiment
by a surprise resolution. Bills were prepared putting
coal and salt on the free list, and Eugene Hale of Maine
was asked to introduce them, under the Monday morning
rule. Mr. Hale consented, and Mr. Blaine promised to recognize
him. The bills were introduced suddenly as arranged,
brought immediately to vote, and, after some skirmishing,
passed, to the despair of Mr. Kelley, who, as Mr. Cox said,
wailed now like Jeremiah, though in the last session he had
talked like Isaiah. “I was in the majority then,” said Mr.
Kelley, ruefully.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sure of the House, there now remained only to make sure
of Mr. Blaine. As the days went on and the appointments
promised were not made, General Brinkerhoff felt more and
more uneasy, but said nothing. Finally one day as he was
on the floor of the House, Mr. Blaine sent a page to him
asking him for an interview:</p>

<p class='c012'>“He then called someone to the chair,” says General Brinkerhoff
in his Recollections, “and as he went out of the south door I went
out of the north door, and went around and met him. He took me
down to the basement and into a room he called his den. He then
locked the door and went to a cupboard and brought out some
refreshments, and we sat down at a little table.</p>

<p class='c014'>“After awhile he told me he wanted to talk with me about the
Ways and Means Committee, and to ask my opinion in regard
to a cast of a committee that was in his mind. He took a pencil
and a slip of paper from a drawer and wrote down nine names and
then turned it around for me to read. I saw that he kept his
finger on the paper, and that he did not intend to let me take it
away, and so I took a little time to study its make-up, and get it
clearly in my memory. I saw at a glance that he was not carrying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>out his agreement, because Dawes was at the head as chairman, and
not Garfield. I saw also as I looked over the list that a majority
of the committee were not revenue reform men, although it was a
combination calculated to deceive any one not fully posted on
individual records.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That a breach of faith was meditated was evident enough, but
just what to do about it was not so evident, and so I asked questions
to gain time as well as information. I asked him why Dawes
instead of Garfield was at the head. ‘That is what I want to talk
about especially, for I find it will make trouble to give Garfield the
chairmanship, and it seems to me that Dawes is sufficiently in
harmony with you people to be satisfactory, and the very fact that
he is not an extreme man will be an advantage to you in the House.’
He said Garfield had not had sufficient service on the committee
to entitle him to promotion over old members like Kelley and
Dawes. ‘Why,’ he said, ‘Kelley would take a fit if I put Garfield
ahead of him.’ ‘Possibly, that may be so,’ I said, ‘but you knew
that just as well when we were in New York as you do now, and I
am very sure our people would not be willing to substitute Dawes
for Garfield in any event, for at heart he is not with us any more
than Kelley.’</p>

<p class='c014'>“The fact was there were only four men on his list who were not
protectionists, and after discussing the matter awhile, he said, ‘This
is not a finality by any means, it is simply tentative and I will make
the committee so that it will be satisfactory.’ He repeated the
word ‘tentative’ two or three times, but I made up my mind at
once that a Ways and Means Committee satisfactory to the revenue
reform people would never be made by Mr. Blaine, and so we
parted after an hour’s talk with the understanding that he would
see me again soon.”</p>

<p class='c006'>That evening General Brinkerhoff met Garfield by appointment.
“You are not to be chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee,” he told him. “The protectionists will be in a
majority on it.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>“You are wrong,” Garfield said; “Mr. Blaine has already
written me assuring me of my appointment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let me see the letter,” said the General. Garfield’s face
fell. He had not the letter. Mr. Blaine had asked that it
be returned because life was uncertain. “You will not be
appointed,” General Brinkerhoff reiterated. Garfield walked
the floor for a few minutes, and then stopping, said: “General
Brinkerhoff, if Mr. Blaine does not appoint me chairman of
the Ways and Means Committee, he is the basest of men.”
He was not appointed, but a few days later Mr. Dawes was.</p>

<p class='c007'>No move could have been made which would have crystallized
so effectually the tariff sentiment of the reformers and
sent them so surely toward the Democrats as this. All over
the country signs of dissatisfaction multiplied. They were
only strengthened by other causes of complaint with the
party—the failure to secure civil service reform and the
awful need of it; the treatment of the South, which had led to
a strong movement, headed by Greeley, in favor of general
amnesty; the delay in resuming specie payment. These
specific causes were intensified by the feeling about Grant.
He had utterly disappointed the hopes of those who had looked
to him to put an end to the open corruption and raiding which
prevailed in Washington at the time of his election, and he had
become almost the tool of some of the very worst elements in
the party. Dissatisfaction had become abuse, and every
evil in the country was laid at his door, an exaggeration Mr.
Cox ridiculed in the next campaign by declaring, “I lay the
horse distemper to Grant. Run me as an anti-epizoötic
candidate at large.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Between the real issues and the dissatisfaction with Grant
there seemed reason enough for revolt, particularly to the
Liberal Republicans of Missouri, who had succeeded in their
bolt; and accordingly in January, 1872, they called a meeting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>of leading reformers in St. Louis. Here it was decided to put
forth a declaration of principle and call a national convention
in Cincinnati, Ohio, in May, 1872, of all those who felt that the
issues were sufficiently important to justify independent action.
Among contributing causes to this movement was the revolt
in the Republican party, growing out of the impeachment
of Andrew Johnson in 1868, and the attempt to read out of the
party the seven Republican Senators who had voted Not
Guilty. The continuing proscription of the “seven traitors”
offended all persons who upheld the right of private judgment
and they naturally rebelled against such party tyranny.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hope of the leaders in the Liberal movement was to
organize an entirely new party and to put forth a platform and
candidates which would secure the support of the Democrats.
The time between the St. Louis and the Cincinnati meetings was
used in an energetic canvass of the country. The result was
that a convention of some seven hundred people met in Cincinnati
in May, but it was not seven hundred people united on
issues. While the Missouri Liberals and their friends led in its
organization, and expected to secure a platform and candidates
to their liking, the convention by a series of fine
manœuvres was captured, for the last man in the United
States whom the tariff reform element would have chosen—and
that was Horace Greeley! Almost before they knew
what had happened to them, the men active in securing the
convention found themselves with the most devoted high protectionist
in the country on their hands, and a meaningless
tariff plank in their platform! A more ironical ending to a
great movement could not be imagined. To be sure, on one
great issue to which the convention was committed, Horace
Greeley had been a leader, and that was amnesty for the
South. He had turned the New York <cite>Tribune’s</cite> full strength
against the policy of revenge and humiliation, which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Republican party so blindly inaugurated, and he had suffered
their severest punishment in consequence. But in no other
particular was he in harmony with them, and a more unfit
man to cope with the ruling corruption could not be imagined.
As the <cite>Nation</cite> well said, he was a man not more remarkable for
generosity and kind-heartedness than for the facility with
which he could be duped, and not more remarkable for his
hatred of knavery than for the difficulty he had in telling
whether a man was a knave or not.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tariff reformers left Cincinnati in despair and uncertainty—what
should they do? A meeting was called
at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York and the situation
discussed. It was a “bad job,” all agreed, but on one
point they could meet, that of amnesty. It was worth
making a fight for. The Democrats would probably endorse
Greeley if they stood by the Cincinnati convention.
The meeting wavered and halted until finally late at night
Carl Schurz in a speech, which those who heard it declare
to have been one of the most eloquent he ever made, turned
them to Greeley. The majority decided to waive tariff reform
for the time being and join the movement to beat Grant.</p>

<p class='c007'>The strength and the respectability of the faction which
had seceded from the Republican party on tariff reform and
kindred issues, alarmed the leaders who had been backing
the iron and wool and copper and salt people in their demands.
They appreciated that they must do something toward reform
or the party would suffer still more seriously. All through
the early months of 1872 a struggle went on to get a bill which
should cut down the surplus without antagonizing any politically
strong special interest. It could not be done. Senator
Sherman finally said frankly to the lobbyists who were besieging
the committee that it was to their interest to have a
reduction made. “In my deliberate judgment,” he said, “it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>is better for the protected industries of the country that this
slight reduction of duties (it was the question of a general 10
per cent reduction) should be made rather than to invite
a contest which will endanger the whole system.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After much struggle Mr. Dawes reported a bill in April,
which he hoped Congress could unite on. Mr. Finkelnburg
of Missouri spoke for the bill. It was not what he wanted,
he said, but it should be supported, because it was a step in
the right direction:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Its chief merit,” said Mr. Finkelnburg, “lies in this, that after
six years of peace it is the first bill reported to the House by a
regular standing committee which proposes to make a substantial
and general, though moderate reduction, in the war duties imposed
upon the leading necessaries of life, the staple articles of consumption
used by the people of the United States. It is the first step
in the scaling downward, the inauguration of a policy of reduction,
and as such I bespeak for it the support of all friends of revenue
reform.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is true the reductions proposed in the bill are very moderate;
so much so that the bill may, with apparent justice, be criticised
for not going far enough. It is not what I would like to see, and
far from my ideas of true revenue reform; but I gave it my support
firstly, because I want to accomplish something practical, and I
felt that if we asked the House to do more it would result in nothing
being done; and secondly, because I recognize a fact which should
govern all legislation of this kind, namely, that changes in a tariff
schedule, which more or less affect business relations and values
throughout a country, ought to be made slowly and gradually, step
by step, leaving to the next year what remains undone in this,
until we arrive at that normal point where the duties may once more
assume a permanent character as they did before the war.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was indeed a reasonable bill to the reasonable man, but
those interests which considered only themselves fought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>fiercely to save what the urgencies of war had given them.
Many a member, it is plain from the debate, would have willingly
supported a more radical lowering of duties, but he had
important constituents goading him to look after them, and
he dared not speak his mind freely. In many cases about the
only argument these gentlemen offered was that they would
willingly enough give up the duty on their coal or salt or
lumber if Pennsylvania would on her iron, Michigan on her
copper, Connecticut on her clocks. There was a pretty
general frank admission that the high tariffs were a bad
business, but “if you get it for your constituents you must
give it to me for mine.” It was a phase which gave great joy
to Mr. Cox, and he mocked at it in a speech long remembered:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Let us be to each other instruments of reciprocal rapine,”
said Mr. Cox. “Michigan steals on copper; Maine on lumber;
Pennsylvania on iron; North Carolina on peanuts; Massachusetts
on cotton goods; Connecticut on hair pins; New Jersey
on spool thread; Louisiana on sugar, and so on. Why not let the
gentleman from Maryland steal coal from them? True, but a
comparative few get the benefit, and it comes out of the body of
the people; true, it tends to high prices, but does not stealing encourage
industry? Let us as moralists, if not as politicians,
rewrite the eighth commandment: Thou shalt steal; because
stealing is right when common.</p>

<p class='c014'>“As I am a Representative of New York, and Onondaga, with
the aid of the foreign solar artisan, evaporates salt, ought I not
also to steal to help Onondaga? Stealing by tariffs, Mr. Chairman,
is, as De Quincey proved of murder, a fine art. If everybody
stole from everybody, is there any reproach to anybody? If everybody
is a burglar, is there any need for anybody to lock up houses?</p>

<p class='c014'>“How happy we shall be when we can all look each other in
the face here, as now I look into the face of the gentleman from
Massachusetts, clasp hands, and say: God bless you, my brother;
you have stolen from me, and I from you; let us love one another.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Then the little unprotected pigs, who are crowded by the big pigs
quietly eating out of the trough, will squeal no more to be let in,
for on this idea all shall be fed by swallowing each other’s food;
and when all are fed, no one loses and we shall be happy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>There was another significant feature to the debate, and
that was the way it got on the nerves of Congress. Before the
session was over there was an almost open admission that they
did not know nor care much whether certain tariffs which were
causing trouble, were just or not. For instance, Senator
Logan of Illinois was greatly disturbed because the tariff on
printed books was only 25 per cent, and that on the paper
which made them was 31½ per cent. He argued long and
earnestly over the matter, but finally was snapped off summarily
by Senator Sherman. “It is like trying to row a
flatboat up the Mississippi River to argue against the Committee
on Finance in the Senate,” wailed poor Mr. Logan.
We mean no disrespect to the gentleman, Mr. Morrill hastened
to assure him, but is it any wonder we are weary of the subject
and want to drop it after hearing delegations and representatives
of all the parties in the business, and after having argued
it out twice in committee? “No,” said Mr. Bayard of Delaware,
“it is not; it only shows the folly of attempting to adjust
duties in this way.” And as a matter of fact, the debate in
the spring of 1872 showed, as most tariff debates have, what
probably every candid member of Congress has always admitted
after a few years of experience, that it is impossible
for a Congress subject to the continual political and commercial
pressure of private interest to make a just tariff bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Dawes Bill was signed formally on June 6th by President
Grant. As it stood its most important features were a
10 per cent reduction on articles manufactured from cotton,
wool, iron, paper, glass, and leather, and an increase of the
free list by such articles as hides, jute, and paper stock, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>a reduction on coal, salt, lumber, and several other articles.
All materials to be used in the construction of vessels built
in the United States for the foreign trade were admitted
free. At the same time a bill was passed removing entirely
the duty on tea and coffee.</p>

<p class='c007'>It had been a hard battle to get the bill through, but it was
certainly a step toward more equable taxation. If the
country had remained prosperous it is probable that in the
next Congress the revenue reformers would have continued
the work of equalization and distribution, but the country
did not remain prosperous. The year 1873 saw a panic of
wide extent, a panic caused by gigantic speculations in railways,
in land securities, in booming schemes of every kind.
Men spent everything they owned in roseate ventures and
then borrowed all their hopeful neighbors would lend, and
this madness followed only seven years after a war, which had
cost the country perhaps 4000 millions of dollars! It was not
a quick, sharp panic with easy recovery. Its shocks recurred
again and again, and the desolation it spread dragged itself
over several years. No time indeed for reform. But not so
bad a time for those who had objected to the lowering of the
duties in the bill of 1872. The falling off of revenue due to
decreased importation was reason enough to them to make
an effort to replace its provisions. They hurried on to this
more rapidly than they would have done perhaps if in 1874
the general dissatisfaction with the Grant Administration
intensified by the hard times had not caused the election of
a majority of Democrats to the House. The protectionists,
having only a short term of power left them, hastened to take
advantage of it. We must have more revenue, they urged.
The surplus of 1873 and 1874 is but $2,000,000. We shall have
nothing for the sinking funds—we must put more taxes on
tobacco and spirits, more duties on molasses and sugar, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>we must restore the 10 per cent reduction on manufactured
goods. It was urged by the tariff reformers that if revenue
was wanted the repeal of the 10 per cent reduction would
help but little—that the restoration of the duty on tea and
coffee was the simplest and fairest—but the protectionists
were determined to get back their 10 per cent, and they did it,
though only after a hard fight and a close vote. And thus it
happened that when the Republicans resigned to the Democrats
in 1875, the majority in the House of Representatives,
which they had held for fifteen years, they left behind them
tariff schedules devised for war needs and enacted by them
under a definite pledge of reduction when the war should be
over and internal taxes removed.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <span class='large'>THE BUSINESS MAN TAKES CHARGE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The bill of 1875 took away from the tariff reformers of the
Republican party practically all they had won in an eight
years’ fight. The duties were again on a war basis, and while
the need of revenue had been the plea for putting them back,
everybody knew that the real victory was to the high protectionists.
What could the Republican revenue-reformers
do? The question came home with force now, for they were
on the eve of a presidential campaign. It became still more
difficult to answer with the appearance of the platform of the
Democratic party, which for the first time in twenty years
came out boldly on the tariff question. That it did so was
due largely to the sagacity and fire of a young Southerner
who was to play a large part in the coming struggles on the
question—Henry Watterson, editor of the Louisville (Ky.)
<cite>Courier-Journal</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Watterson was what may properly be called a “born
journalist.” His father before him had been an active
newspaper man and almost constantly since he was sixteen,
when he had edited a juvenile sheet whose political editorials
had been copied all over Tennessee, he had been connected in
one way or another with a newspaper. At eighteen he had
written for <cite>Harper’s Weekly</cite> and <cite>The Times</cite> in New York.
At twenty he was serving under Roger A. Pryor in Washington.
After the war broke out he had not been able to resist
the army, but even there he broke ranks once to establish at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Chattanooga a semi-military daily which he called <cite>The Rebel</cite>,
and which for a year he made the delight of the Confederate
army. At the close of the war Mr. Watterson started a paper
in Nashville, but in 1868 he was asked to take a position on
the Louisville <cite>Journal</cite>—a paper made famous by George D.
Prentice. He did so, and from the start his influence was
magnetic. The paper grew in popularity and power until
its editor, with good reason, was called the Dictator not only
of his state but of his party. Politics was his element, and
he fought for whatever cause he championed with a vigor, a
wit, an eloquence that were the terror of his opponents.
His opinions on the tariff were uncompromising. He had no
patience with anything but “tariff for revenue only,” and
he went to the Convention of 1876 resolved to have his
way on that point, and he had it by writing in the plank
himself. It was a very characteristic bit of Wattersonian
literature:</p>

<p class='c012'>Reform is necessary in the sum and modes of Federal taxation
to the end that capital may be set free from distrust and labor
lightly burdened. We denounce the present tariff levied upon
nearly 4000 articles as a masterpiece of injustice, inequality,
and false pretence. It yields a dwindling and not a yearly rising
revenue.</p>

<p class='c014'>It has impoverished many industries to subsidize a few.</p>

<p class='c014'>It prohibits imports that might purchase the products of American
labor.</p>

<p class='c014'>It has degraded American commerce from the first to an inferior
rank on the high seas.</p>

<p class='c014'>It has cut down the sales of American manufacture at home and
abroad, and depleted the returns of American agriculture—an
industry followed by half our people.</p>

<p class='c014'>It costs the people five times more than it produces to the
treasury, obstructs the processes of production, and wastes the
fruit of labor.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>It promotes fraud, fosters smuggling, enriches dishonest officials,
and bankrupts honest merchants. We demand that all custom-house
taxation shall be only for revenue.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is evident from what we have seen of the record of the
Republican tariff-reformers that no great number of them
would follow the Democrats in any such radical program as
Mr. Watterson’s. Wells and Brinkerhoff, in fact, were about
the only prominent tariff leaders of 1872 who turned to the
Democrats in 1876. Carl Schurz, Murat Halstead, and Horace
White all stayed with the party. But there was an even
more important question than what the Republicans would
do. It was what the Democrats themselves would do. Were
they ready as a party to stand by “tariff for revenue only”?
The question of Mr. Hayes’s election was no sooner settled
than it became evident that they were not. The Democrats
in the House divided completely on the question, the wing
following the party platform being led by Colonel W. R.
Morrison of Illinois and Roger Q. Mills of Texas—the protectionist
wing being led by Samuel J. Randall of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Randall was an avowed protectionist-Democrat, and
a man who, his colleagues had learned, usually was able to
get his way. Randall had first entered Congress in 1862.
He was a quiet, persistent, hard-working person who attracted
little attention for several years; then the Republicans, sure
of their majority and wishing to expedite business, undertook
to adopt rules which would prevent obstruction. The quiet
Mr. Randall set himself against the attempt. He led the
small Democratic minority with a skill so unusual that more
than once he blocked the Republicans’ way until it was too
late to pass the measure. His endurance seemed unlimited.
From one session lasting 46 hours and 25 minutes where Randall
had forced the roll to be called seventy-five times, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>came out as fresh as he went in. At another time in the fight
over the “Force Bill” he was on the floor for seventy-two
consecutive hours. After his party secured the House in
1874, Randall was put at the head of the Committee on
Appropriations, where he cut down appropriations some
$30,000,000. He came to the Speaker’s chair in time to preside
through one of the most critical episodes in the history
of Congress—the dispute over the Tilden-Hayes election.
His conduct at this time was eminently cool, wise, and fair,
and greatly strengthened his position in the country. It was
not alone his parliamentary skill which won him followers.
His presence counted for much. Randall was one of the
handsomest men of his day—with a face chiselled like an old
Roman’s and lit by a pair of large dark eyes of amazing fire
and softness. Speak of Sam Randall to-day to one of his old
colleagues and it will not be long before he will tell you with
softened voice of “those wonderful eyes,” “that classic face.”
Randall’s force and charm were such that they overcame
a lack of studious habits, of reflection, and of broad views.</p>

<p class='c007'>But as has been said, Randall was a protectionist, and he
put now at the head of the Ways and Means Committee a
man of moderate protectionist leanings, an old-time shipping
merchant of New York City, Fernando Wood. Wood was
a picturesque character, who had made a name for himself
politically as the mayor of New York from 1854 to 1858,
when the town needed reform quite as badly as it ever has
since. He succeeded in getting himself reëlected mayor
again in 1861, when he stirred up the ire of the North by proposing
seriously that New York City secede and set up as a
free town! Wood at once went to work on a tariff bill, but
he took few of his party into his confidence, and he ignored
those who, like Wells, were considered experts. Indeed, he
went his way so arrogantly that the opposing wing of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>party broke out in expostulation in December, 1877, Roger Q.
Mills introducing the following resolution:</p>

<p class='c012'>“That the Committee of Ways and Means be instructed so to
revise the tariff as to make it purely a tariff for revenue, and not
for protecting one class of citizens by plundering another.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The resolution stirred up Mr. Wood considerably. It was
“nonsense,” he said. The Committee of Ways and Means
would discharge its duty faithfully, irrespective of the resolution.
It would in due time report the results of its deliberations
to the House, and in the meantime it required no instructions
of any kind in the matter. A more menacing sign
of unrest over the Wood Bill than Mr. Mills’s resolution,
came about the same time—a flood of petitions against
any revision of the tariff not made by its friends. By actual
count 177 petitions were introduced. They came from
twenty-nine different States: from New York 22, from Pennsylvania
28, from Massachusetts 17, from Maine 15. That
they originated with a protective steering committee somewhere
in the background—that is, that they were not spontaneous
outbreaks—was evident from the fact that the
phrasing of the whole 177 was practically identical. Whether
they came from Alabama or Maine, Pennsylvania or Kansas,
whether they pleaded for iron, or lumber, or cotton, or copper,
or paper, or silk, they nearly all plead in identical terms that
Congress would take no action concerning a revision of
tariff duties “until after it shall have ascertained by an official
inquiry the condition of the industries of the country and
the nature of such tariff legislation <i>as in the opinion of practical
business men</i> would best promote the restoration of general
prosperity.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether it was known to Congressmen generally or not
where this flood of petitions originated, it must have been to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>many. As a matter of fact the “steering committee” behind
it was the most powerful protective organization the
country had seen at that time—the Industrial League of
Pennsylvania. Formed about 1867, the League was intended
to be national in extent and to represent all protected
industries. Its first president was Peter Cooper, and its
executive committee was made up of the foremost manufacturers
of the day. From the beginning the Pennsylvania
branch dominated in the League largely because of the energy
of its president, the Hon. Daniel J. Morrell, and of its secretary,
Cyrus Elder, and of the ability and far-sightedness of its
Executive Council, including Mr. Joseph Wharton and Mr.
Henry C. Lea of Philadelphia.</p>

<p class='c007'>At once on its organization the League had become a power
in Washington. The rapid removal of the internal war
taxes had been due to its pressure. The Schenck Bill of
1870 had been practically written by the chairman of its
Executive Council, Mr. Joseph Wharton. The League’s
latest achievement had been the restoration of the 10 per cent
reduction of duties made in 1872. It thus came to its new
attack—a tariff made by “practical business men”—with
all the prestige of an important victory.</p>

<p class='c007'>The methods used by the League in carrying on campaigns
were simple enough. It had secured, after much careful
selection, a body of correspondents in manufacturing centres,
chiefly laboring men. These correspondents circulated the
League’s literature and secured names to its petitions. The
petitions once filled out were returned to the headquarters of
the League, and from there forwarded to the proper Congressman,
who, so far as any printed sign went, might have supposed
the document spontaneous in his district. The petitions
were then followed up by personal letters from individual
workingmen, sent direct to the Congressmen, and by personal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>visits from manufacturers. It was one of the most extensive
and thorough organizations for bringing apparently spontaneous
pressure to bear on Congressmen which the country
has ever seen. It goes without saying that the political
power of the organization was enormous—particularly in
Pennsylvania, where it practically dictated who should be
elected. Already Mr. Blaine himself had recognized the
influence of the Pennsylvania branch by consulting the head
of the Executive Council of Pennsylvania, Mr. Joseph Wharton,
about whom he should make chairman of the Ways and
Means Committee in 1871. It was this powerful association
which now came out for no revision until after the “opinions
of practical business men” had been secured.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not until March (1878) that Mr. Wood brought in
his bill. He tabulated interestingly his objections to the
tariff in operation. They were: Too many articles mentioned
(2172); compound duties; ambiguity; the articles for the
rich less highly taxed than those of the poor; encouragement
of fraud; prohibitory duties, causing loss of revenue and
enhanced prices to consumers; cumbersome machinery of
operation; expensive collections. He confessed that the
bill he presented did not deal with these demerits as they deserved,
that he would cut the duties 50 per cent, if he could,
instead of 15 per cent, as he had, but he had done the best he
could.</p>

<p class='c007'>The features of the Wood Bill were novel and interesting.
It had but one list—the dutiable; any article not mentioned
there was supposed to be free. It reduced the number of
dutiable articles from 1524 to 575. It put duties on many
raw materials. It imposed but <i>one</i> kind of duty on an article—ad
valorem or specific as seemed to him best. It levied a
retaliatory duty of 10 per cent on goods coming from countries
which discriminated against the United States. It allowed a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>drawback on all exported goods containing foreign materials.
It allowed the purchase of foreign-built ships by Americans and
the free importation of ship-building materials. The general
object of the bill Mr. Wood said was to revive commerce
without materially affecting manufacturing interests whose
right to protection for a still longer time Mr. Wood recognized.
He considered his bill merely a beginning of a new policy in
tariffs, looking toward the final complete withdrawal of the
system of taxing consumers for the good of private individuals.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the first the Wood Bill was cursed by the indifference
of a large number of his own party,—men like S. S. Cox and
Morrison, who did not speak at all on it,—by the open opposition
of the moderate Republican tariff men like Garfield and
Kasson, and by the bitter condemnation of the Industrial
League, which called it “blundering,” “ignorant,” “an
attempt to overthrow the industrial system of the country.”
Naturally, under these circumstances the debate upon it
languished. Indeed, the only personal incident in the debate
which is interesting from this range is that at this time William
McKinley of Ohio made his first speech in support of protection
of American industry. It was a strictly orthodox
speech calculated to give comfort to Mr. Kelley, and it was
used as an opportunity for presenting a petition which the
Democrats had been trying to keep out signed by over
100,000 laboring men of seventeen different States, praying
for a 10 per cent <i>increase</i> of duties.</p>

<p class='c007'>The character of the bill as well as the lukewarm attitude
of the House toward it made a fine opening for Mr. Kelley, and
he thoroughly enjoyed himself riddling it. He was an impressive
speaker with a sonorous voice which had been carefully
trained, for Kelley once had thought of going on the stage,
and in preparation had studied with both Booth and Barrett.
He now went at the measure with joy, and in the course of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>his speech gibed Wood unmercifully for yielding to a rhetorical
temptation which seems to beset every writer who speaks on
taxation; that is, imitating Sydney Smith’s famous paragraph
on the overtaxed English farmer.</p>

<p class='c007'>In introducing his bill Wood had said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“The farmer in the West, where lumber is scarce, pays a tax
of 20 per cent on the lumber his house is built of; a tax of 35 per
cent on the paint it is painted with; of 60 per cent on his window
glass; of 35 per cent on the nails; of 53 per cent on the screws;
of 30 per cent on the door-locks; of from 35 to 40 per cent on the
hinges; of 35 per cent on the wallpaper; of from 60 to 70 per cent
on his carpet; of 40 per cent on his crockery; of 38 per cent on
his iron hollowware; of 35 per cent on his cutlery; 40 per cent on
his glassware; of from 35 per cent to 40 per cent on the linen he
uses in his household; of 51 per cent on the common castile soap
he uses; 48 per cent on the starch—”</p>

<p class='c006'>And so on, ending up:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Suffice it to say that the furnishings of his child’s cradle and
the coffin in which he is finally buried pay a direct tax or one enhanced
in price by our tariff system.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kelley sat smiling through the passage, and when he came
to discuss the bill said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I was amused by the chairman’s expression of sympathy with
the overtaxed farmer.... It was so amusing to note the gravity
and pathos with which he started his poor farmer out to buy taxed
hardware, shoes, etc., for himself and clothes and medicine for
his wife. When I first read that gem of his speech in my youth, or
earliest manhood, just after Sydney Smith had produced it, it
made an impression on my mind that still lingers. But I have
become so used to hearing it that when he commenced its delivery
with such fine effect I found myself in the condition of Diggory in
‘She stoops to Conquer’: ‘Diggory, you talk too much,’ the squire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>said; ‘you must neither talk nor laugh while attending on this
party,’ ‘Ecod, Squire, then you must not tell that story of old
Grouse in the gun-room, because I have been so used to laughing
at that story for the last twenty years that I am afraid I can’t hold
myself.’</p>

<p class='c014'>“Sir, for the last twenty years I have been so in the habit of
laughing, at least in my sleeve, when hearing gentlemen reproduce
that admirable novelty that I could not help doing so when the
chairman of my committee startled me by reciting it. I have it
before me as uttered by the gentleman, then from Ohio, but who was
carpet-bagged to New York, and who is sometimes known by the
<i>sobriquet</i> of ‘Sunset,’ as he delivered it in 1864.... It was quoted
the other evening by the gentleman from Mississippi.... Subsequently
I heard it from my friend, the late James Brooks. Then
from our friend, S. S. Marshall, of Illinois, and there has never been
a tariff bill under discussion that I have not heard it three or
four times; and I repeat I could not help laughing when the chairman
of the committee got it off with such solemnity.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The Wood Bill never got out of the House, but it was not
because interest in the tariff was abating. There was a deep
unrest in the country on the subject, and it was stirred by a
band of tariff-reformers of great ability. It is doubtful,
indeed, if we have ever had as able a group of teachers as those
who kept up their hammering in the ’80’s, undismayed by
the disaster of ’72. To Perry and Wells and Horace White,
whom we have already met, should be added two in particular,
William G. Sumner and Joseph S. Moore.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Sumner, who since 1872 had held the chair of history
and economics in Yale University, was a young man educated
at Geneva, Göttingen, and Oxford. He had begun his career
as a clergyman of the Protestant Episcopal Church, but had
left it for academic work. A few years ago at a dinner in
New York, Mr. Sumner explained how he became interested
in the tariff question: “Thirty-five or forty years ago,” he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>said, “I became a free trader for two great reasons as far as I
can now remember. One was because as a student of political
economy my whole mind revolted against the notion of
magic that is involved in the notion of a protective
tariff.... The other reason was because it seemed to me
that the protective tariff system nourished erroneous ideas of
success in business and produced immoral results in the
minds and hopes of the people.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Sumner did not add at this time another interesting
fact—that he was first aroused to active public efforts
against protection by Grant’s suspension of the office of
Special Commissioner of Revenue in order to get rid of the
reports of David A. Wells. It was a very good illustration
of the effect of trying to silence honest speech on a question
of public interest. The high protectionists, in ridding themselves
of Wells in Congress, turned him into the public
forum, where he was immediately reënforced by Mr. Sumner.
Two voices were raised where there had been one.</p>

<p class='c007'>In journalism the most effective writer at this time was the
“Parsee Merchant,” Joseph S. Moore. Moore was a clever
German-Hebrew, who had come to New York from Bombay
and had secured a place in the New York Custom House.
He had first attracted attention in 1869 by a series of letters
to the New York <cite>World</cite>, signed “Adhersey Curiosibhoy.”
These letters, addressed to “Sahib Greeley,” told of the adventures
of a Parsee merchant who came to New York from
India to buy goods. His theory in coming, he said, was
that as the United States was the land where certain things his
firm traded in were raised they ought to be cheaper there;
and as the United States bought jute, seeds, gums, etc., from
India, he could establish a direct trade instead of the indirect
through London. He wanted copper, but copper he found cost
five cents more a pound in New York than in London. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>wanted cotton prints, but they were 25 per cent dearer here
than in England. He wanted enamelled hides, but they cost
25 per cent more than in England. He went to New Haven
to buy carriages, but the price was $1100 in currency against
90 guineas in London. He wanted iron; it cost 80 cents more
than in England, 60 per cent more than in Bombay. He
wanted wood-screws, but the “wood screw sahib” laughed
and told him he had a better market at home than any the
Parsee could bring him and in it he could sell all he could make
at from 70 to 100 per cent more than the foreigner paid.
Discouraged, the Parsee wrote a series of over forty letters
to “Sahib Greeley,” begging him to reflect and weigh the
facts in his “great political economical mind” and explain
to him why a policy which produced such prices for the people
of America and made trade with foreigners impossible, was
not stupid.</p>

<p class='c007'>So effective was the Parsee that he greatly incensed the
Industrial League. The Executive Council declared him to
be subsidized by British gold and attributed to him much
for which he was in no way responsible; for instance, the
Wood Bill, of which Moore really disapproved, they characterized
as a “crazy structure contrived by a foreigner who has
been so long tolerated in the New York Custom House that
he has grown to imagine himself an authority.” The opposition
to the Parsee was so strong that Secretary Sherman
finally removed him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only effective bit of tariff legislation in this period,
1876 to 1882, was due largely to the Parsee Merchant—the
removal of the duty on quinine. The wholesale price
of this medicine, enormous quantities of which were consumed,
particularly in the Middle West, had risen in 1877 and 1878
as high as $4.75 an ounce, the highest point recorded in the
history of the business. The Parsee merchant took up the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>matter in the press. The duty on quinine—40 per cent—was,
he declared, “a sickening, disgraceful blood tax.”
It was made by only four houses in the United States, all
of them manufacturing chemists who were growing enormously
rich—which was true. They brought in their bark
free, and they were able to make their own price for the product.
The press took up the cry. Frightened by the popular
indignation, one firm of quinine manufacturers offered
Moore $100,000 to withdraw his opposition. Several young
Congressmen saw the chance, and in rapid succession ten different
bills repealing the duty on quinine were brought into the
House. The one brought to vote was introduced by James
McKenzie, a young Kentuckian. It went through without
debate, a victory which earned for Mr. McKenzie a name by
which he is called to-day in Kentucky—“Quinine Jim!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Senate was less in a hurry about the quinine bill, for
there it met the opposition of Mr. Morrill, who on principle
had always fought against legislating a duty off or on a
single article without considering those related to it. He
pointed out now that the makers of quinine used several
articles on which they had to pay duty—fusel-oil, distilled
spirits, soda ash, East India bark (if they used that variety,
which few of them did). To compel the manufacturers
to pay these duties and give them no compensating duty on
their product was unfair. But the tide was against him.
“Raise a cry of ‘mad dog,’” Mr. Morrill commented, “and
the dog is sure to die.” And he did—the bill passed.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a matter of fact the effect of the removal of the duty was
magical. In five years from the date the bill became a
law—July, 1879—quinine had fallen from $3.40 per ounce to
$1.23, and in ten years, July, 1889, to 35 cents, in 1905 to
21 cents. The quinine manufacturers were thunderstruck.
They declared that they were ruined, and very likely they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>believed so. At all events, they discharged their hands and
closed their works. As the country was not moved to tears
by the spectacle, they gradually reopened their factories and
resumed business, and eventually became more prosperous on
a free-trade basis than they had been before. They remain
a bright and shining example of the ability of Americans
to compete with foreigners in a fair field and without favor
in any industry not forbidden by our soil and climate. The
quinine bill was the one tariff result the Democrats had to
show for the four years they had held the House!</p>

<p class='c007'>The presidential campaign of 1880 did not change the attitude
of the two parties at all on the question. The Democrats
repeated their “tariff for revenue only” plank, the
Republicans their declaration that “duties levied for the
purpose of revenue should discriminate so as to favor American
labor.” It is doubtful if either party expected at the time
of their conventions that the tariff would cut much of a figure
in the campaign. Garfield, from whom if from any Republican
of good party standing, sound counsel on the question
should be expected, kept suspiciously silent. He knew as
well as anybody, since Greeley had long ago told him, that
the only objection the dominant faction of the party had
against him was that he was not “sufficiently protective.”</p>

<p class='c007'>By instinct and training indeed Garfield was a free trader.
He was a Williams College man, and there had come under the
influence of Professor Perry’s vigorous and clear reasoning.
He came out of college committed to Perry’s ideas. From
the beginning of his public life finance interested him, and
he lost no chance to familiarize himself with the subject. In
1862, being called to Washington from the field to sit in a
courtmartial for some weeks, he spent all his leisure with
Secretary Chase studying the Treasury Department. In
1863 he was sent to Congress, where he was put on the military
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>committee, but two years later, at his own request, he was
transferred to the Committee of Ways and Means. Here
he attacked all problems with resolution and industry. He
pored over Tooke’s “History of Prices,” mastered thoroughly
the history of tariffs in England and the United States, and
acquainted himself with all the intricacies of the schedules.
From the first he set himself against the efforts of Stevens and
Kelley to place protection before revenue as an object of
the tariff. Commerce and the consumers were quite as important
as manufacturers, he insisted. He took a middle
ground in argument, which he summed up in 1866 as follows:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Duties should be so high that our manufacturers can fairly
compete with the foreign product, but not so high as to enable
them to drive out the foreign article, enjoy a monopoly of the trade,
and regulate the price as they please. To this extent I am a
protectionist. If our government pursues this line of policy
steadily, we shall, year by year, approach more nearly to the basis
of free trade, because we shall be more nearly able to compete with
other nations on equal terms. I am for a protection which leads
to ultimate free trade. I am for that free trade which can be
achieved only through protection.”</p>

<p class='c006'>One excellent feature of Garfield’s tariff work was his
willingness to consider all the facts. When the attack began
in Congress on David Wells, one of the first manœuvres was
an attempt to prevent the printing of his reports. Mr.
Garfield protested forcibly:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I confess my great surprise,” he said, “at the opposition of
the gentleman from Pennsylvania to the printing of this report
of the Special Commissioner of the Revenue.... He admits, in the
first place, that the facts stated are generally correct—that the
statistics collected and arranged in tables are true and correctly
stated, but declares that the marshalling of the facts is dangerous—that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>they are put together in such a way, and such inferences are
drawn from them, that the report is dangerous to Congress, and to
the enlightened people of the country. The gentleman asks this
House to make a humiliating confession in which I, for one, am not
ready to join. If any theories or opinions of mine can be damaged
by facts, so much the worse for my theories. An officer who has
served the country so ably and faithfully as the Special Commissioner
of the Revenue deserves well of the country. I trust the
motion to print will prevail.”</p>

<p class='c006'>As we have seen, the tariff reformers of 1870–72 really numbered
Garfield as one of them and wanted him as the head of
the Ways and Means Committee—a position he would have
had had it not been for Mr. Blaine’s slipperiness. The events
that followed—the panic of 1873, the outspoken plank of
the Democrats in 1876 in favor of tariff for revenue only,
the effort of his party to keep quiet on the tariff—did not
change Garfield’s views, though they did make him a shade
more cautious in expressing them.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he came to face a campaign for the presidency in 1880,
he must have realized that whatever he thought about the
tariff would count for little if a struggle were precipitated.
He had nineteen iron foundries in blast in his Ohio district,
and the watch their owners kept of him creeps out more than
once in his speeches. He must have known that in case
it should be needed these gentlemen were ready to make the
biggest fight they had ever made for high protection. Indeed,
only a few months before the nomination the ablest one
among the organized metal workers, Mr. Joseph Wharton,
had openly served notice of their intention on the coming
administration. Mr. Wharton was speaking in Pittsburg
on “The American Ironmaster,” and said: “<i>It is meet that
we should declare to the country that we will support no party and
no candidate who cannot be depended upon by something better
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>than election-day promises to protect and defend home labor. It
is fitting for us to call ‘hands off’ to those who are itching to tear
our tariff laws to shreds; to call upon the President in advance
to refrain from meddling with commercial treaty-making and
to veto, as he doubtless would, any measure injurious to home
industry which a hostile majority in Congress may pass</i>; to
call upon the representatives of all other American industries
to stand by us as we will stand by them in resisting all changes
in the tariff laws and all tariff-making by treaty until these
laws can be carefully and prudently revised by a Congress or
a commission known to be devoted to the interests of the
nation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>That Garfield knew of this speech is certain, for a copy of it
bearing his stamp was turned over to the Congressional Library
when he left Congress in the spring of 1880. Altogether it was
enough to make a man cautious, and it was certainly a mark
of political sagacity on his part that he said nothing in his
letter of acceptance about the tariff issue. But it was
not to be downed. The Republicans, failing at the opening
of the campaign to excite anybody about the South,
suddenly attacked the Democratic phrase, “tariff for
revenue only.” What did it mean? Why, nothing if
not the destruction of the “home market,” the consequent
shutting down of all American manufactories, the idleness of
all American laboring men, a reign of “pauper labor,” the
end of “prosperity.” Unfortunately for the Democrats,
their candidate, General W. S. Hancock, a splendid soldier
and gentleman, apparently was not certain that the phrase
“tariff for revenue only” meant anything in particular. He
tried to parry lightly with his famous remark that the tariff
was only “a local affair.” The more he and his supporters
talked, the more of a tangle they made of it. It was quite
apparent if the tariff was to be a live issue they were too uncertain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>and too divided on it to handle it. The Republicans,
on the contrary, came out boldly for protection to American
industry, and on this they won. They won—but the victory
seemed only to make more insistent the demand for revision.
“I suppose,” said Mr. Morrill, regretfully, “that if the
Bible has to be revised from time to time the tariff may
have to be.”</p>

<p class='c007'>If there had been no other reason at this time, the piling
up of the surplus would in itself have forced a revision. The
return of good times which began to be perceptible in 1878–79
had of course stimulated imports. In 1878–79 nearly $215,000,000
in duties had been collected; in 1879–80, $386,000,000.
In these two years the national debt was reduced by a
hundred million dollars, and there was more money left in
the Treasury than they knew what to do with. Of course a
stop had to be put to this. But more imperative than the
surplus was public opinion. It was suspicious of high protection.
The results of the census of 1880 had begun to filter
through the country, and accordingly people began to compare
the last decade—1870–80, which had been lived under
a tariff of about 42 per cent (on dutiable goods)—with the
one from 1850–60, lived under a tariff of about 20 per cent.
In each had occurred a disastrous panic. In each there had
been, in spite of panics, a great growth in agriculture, in population,
in manufacturing. Taken on the whole, which had
been the more normal growth?</p>

<p class='c007'>To start with, it was evident that one claim of the high
protectionists was a humbug—that is, given protection you
had prosperity. Mr. Kelley, as we have seen, had become a
high protectionist in 1859, because low tariff—he called it
free trade—had not prevented a panic in 1857. But neither
had a high tariff prevented the panic of 1873. “Where,”
exclaimed the Parsee merchant, “was the Baal of protection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>all this time? Why did he not come to the relief of this distress?
Alas, he was as lame, as impotent, and as false as the
Baal in the Bible. The one was unable to strike a lucifer
match in the plains of Judea three thousand years ago, and
the other could not light a blast furnace in Pennsylvania.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The census showed, too, that the general growth between
1850 and  1860 was <i>greater</i> than between 1870 and 1880.
Capital had increased in the first decade about 90 per cent,
in the second but 32 per cent; hands employed 37 per cent
in the first, 33 per cent in the second; wages 60 per cent
in the first, 22 per cent in the second; materials used 86 per
cent in the first, 36 per cent in the second; products of
manufacture 85 per cent in the first, 27 per cent in the second.
The increase of the second decade over the first had been
amazing in certain specific cases, as in iron and steel. In
1860 the iron production had been but 821,223 tons; in
1880 it was 3,835,191. In 1860 it was 60 pounds per capita;
in 1880, 171 pounds. It was protection that had done this,
said the Iron and Steel Association, but why had it not done
as much for wool? As we have seen, the wool interests had
secured the passage of a special bill in 1867 giving them the
highest protection they had ever had, but in spite of it the industry
had lagged. Evidently protection was not infallible.
There were other elements in the problem of prosperity—what
were they? Again, what about the prosperity it claimed to
produce—that of iron and steel, for instance—was that
prosperity equally divided? Was a high tariff as good a
distributor as it was a generator?</p>

<p class='c007'>All of these questions had to be answered, but how was it
to be done? Not by a Congress in which “tariff for revenue
only” Democrats and “revenue-reform” Republicans were
at large, decided the Industrial League. Their notion of
revision was to have it done by their own representatives, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>at once they began an active campaign for a commission, such
as was hinted at in the petitions of 1877 and in Mr. Wharton’s
Pittsburg speech in 1879, quoted above. In November, 1881,
a great tariff convention was called in New York by the manufacturers,
and this body committed itself to the idea of a
Tariff Commission.</p>

<p class='c007'>Naturally, all this agitation had stirred Congress. Early
in 1880 the Senate had passed a bill providing for a commission,
but the House, jealous of its rights in the matter of
devising revenue bills, did not agree. Now, however, the
Secretary of the Treasury asked for a commission, President
Arthur in his first message asked for one, the Industrial League
kept up the pressure, and finally in the spring of 1882 the
House consented. The idea of Senator Eaton of Connecticut,
with whom the bill for the commission originated, was that
it should be composed of nine members—six experts, one
for each of the six great industries of the country; two
statisticians such as “David A. Wells of Connecticut and
R. M. T. Hunter of Virginia,” and as chairman “one of the
great governing heads of the country, not an expert in anything
except in all that makes men great.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Wharton’s idea, as given at the Tariff Convention, was
that “each of the chief groups of industry should be represented
by one man.... For president, a man of high standing,
preferably one known to his fellow-citizens as having
acceptably performed important public service, and of really
exalted character and intelligence, should be chosen. For
secretary, a man well versed in the working of our existing
laws, in Treasury rulings and judicial decisions, and in the
ways of custom houses and the tricks or evasions of unscrupulous
importers, would be most valuable.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It might be necessary that what is loosely called the Free
Trade element should be represented on the commission;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>both political parties should certainly be. Seeing that the
appointments would be made by a Republican President,
and that the Republican party is firmly committed to the
principle of Protection to home industry, it would obviously
be right that a majority of the commission should be
Republicans and that a majority also should be distinctly
Protectionists, but extremists of every kind are to be avoided.”</p>

<p class='c007'>President Arthur evidently had both of these views in
mind in appointing the commission, which he did as soon as
the House gave its consent, but his own notion was somewhat
more liberal. He cut the representatives of special industries
down to four: wool manufacturers, wool growers, sugar, and
iron and steel. John L. Hayes, the efficient manager and
lobbyist of the Wool Manufacturers’ Association, was made
chairman of the body—a choice probably obligatory on
Arthur, such was Hayes’s influence among high protectionists
in the country. The suspicion the wool growers had of the
wool manufacturers (the latter wanting free wool) made it
necessary to give them a special representative, and Austin
M. Garland of Illinois was appointed—a fair-minded man
willing to consider that there were other interests than wool
in the country. Sugar was looked after by Duncan F. Kenner
of Louisiana. He had been a member of the Ways and Means
Committee of the Confederate Congress, and since the close
of the war had been active in the reconstruction of his state.
Kenner’s interest in a protective tariff centred around sugar
entirely. The one really broad-minded man among the
representatives of industries was Henry W. Oliver, Jr., of
Pennsylvania, an iron manufacturer. Oliver was a man of
large experience and foresight, and a keen judge of men, and
from the start he threw his influence on the commission to the
consideration of the general interest as well as of iron and
steel—which he by no means neglected!</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>An excellent appointment, made at the suggestion of Mr.
McKinley, was Judge Jacob A. Ambler of Ohio. Judge Ambler
was an old-fashioned country lawyer, able, learned, and honest—a
man jealous of the honor of any office he held or trust he
handled, full of contempt for greed, extravagance, and grafting,
shrewd in detecting them, and relentless in punishing them.
His influence on the commission was most healthy. It was
due to President Arthur’s knowledge of the Custom House
administration (Arthur was Collector of the Port of New York
from 1871 to 1878, when he was suspended by Hayes) that
William H. McMahon, for twenty years an officer of the New
York Custom House, was put on the board. McMahon had
no interest in any phase of the question except administration,
but that he knew from top to bottom, and his knowledge was
invaluable to the commission. In order that there might
be a statistician in the number, Arthur appointed a young man
from the Census Bureau, Robert P. Porter. Porter was an
Englishman and a free trader, who had found his way to
America at sixteen, and had become a journalist in Chicago.
In 1877 he had published an article in the <cite>Princeton Review</cite>
which attracted the attention of President Hayes, and from
which the latter quoted fully in one of the speeches made on
his Western journey in 1878. When Hayes reached Chicago
on this trip, Porter was presented to him, and the President
at once claimed him for the Census Bureau. Here he made
many friends, among them Judge Kelley, who lost no time in
converting him to protection and gladly backed him for the
commission.</p>

<p class='c007'>The remaining members were John W. H. Underwood of
Georgia and Alexander R. Boteler of West Virginia, two
gentlemen who were appointed chiefly that their respective
sections might be represented.</p>

<p class='c007'>The announcement of the commission awakened no great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>enthusiasm anywhere. It was not sufficiently strong in
business representation to make the Industrial League feel
secure, and the appointment of Mr. Hayes as chairman naturally
aroused the suspicion of moderate tariff men. Nor
did that portion of its work obvious to the public increase
confidence. Its first business, of course, was to get information
about the actual industrial condition of the country.
It set out to do this chiefly by means of public hearings
in various cities. Starting out in July at Long Branch for
three months it junketed about from Long Branch to New
York, from New York to Boston, from Boston to Rochester,
from Rochester to Buffalo, then in turn to Cleveland, Detroit,
Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Louisville, Chicago, Milwaukee,
St. Paul, Des Moines, St. Louis, Nashville,
Chattanooga, Atlanta, Wilmington, North Carolina, Richmond,
Baltimore, New York again, then Pittsburg, Wheeling,
Philadelphia, and finally back to Long Branch.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this time 604 witnesses were listened to, and many of
them questioned at length. They were of all shades of
opinion, from the uncompromising free trader, like Professor
W. G. Sumner, to the equally uncompromising higher protectionist,
like the Iron and Steel Association. They were of
all shades of selfishness, from the petty selfishness of a man
who refused to consider what effect the duty he wanted would
have on a related industry on the ground that he “had no
interest in that business,” to the enlightened selfishness of the
big iron man who advised lower tariff on iron and steel in
order to placate public opinion and so save the system. A
great number of witnesses wanted <i>more</i> protection. The
chemists pleaded for a restoration of the duty on quinine.
Mr. Joseph Wharton pointed proudly to his great nickel and
steel works as proofs of what protection could do for infant
industries, and urged that it be applied next to tin plate.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Mr. John Roach of Chester, Pennsylvania, farmer, iron
manufacturer, ship-builder and ship-owner, employer of
3000 workingmen with a weekly pay roll of $33,000, gave his
experience as a proof that upon protection depended the
prosperity and the future of the country. In Mr. Roach’s
judgment all business irregularities came from a failure
to carry out the doctrine to its logical results, which logical
results were prohibitive tariffs for all raw and manufactured
products possible to our country, and subsidies for all industries
which could not be reached by duties, such as ship-building.</p>

<p class='c007'>While praises of the results of protection and pleas for more
of it were in the majority, there was considerable complaint
of its damages and demands for freer trade. It is true, said
the German silver makers in answer to Mr. Wharton, that <i>you</i>
are making money, but how about us? We have to pay so
much for nickel that we cannot sell in foreign markets, and
it was pointed out that the Meriden Britannia Company had
been obliged to establish a factory in Canada in order to keep
a foreign market for its goods—a factory it still operates.
What of that? said Mr. Wharton. “There is no market in
the world that is comparable to this country as a market of
manufactured goods.” All very well, retorted the people
who used nickel, if you have a nickel monopoly and the market
wants more than you can supply!</p>

<p class='c007'>There were others that complained in the same way that
the higher cost of materials cut them off from a foreign market.
Colonel Albert A. Pope, the great bicycle manufacturer of
the day, said that he was shut out of South America by
English makers. He could offset the extra wage cost here
by his more efficient machinery and methods, but his materials
were so much dearer that he could not compete. A manufacturer
of neckwear and trimmings complained that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>could not sell his goods in foreign markets because his imported
materials cost too much. The carriage-builders
claimed that previous to the Morrill tariff they had a market
in Cuba and South America, but they had been run out
entirely by France, who could put goods there at half the
American price. The oil cloth manufacturer pleaded for
free trade. “If you give us free trade, we can send goods
to any part of the world and do an enormous business.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Consumers of copper complained that they paid, in 1875,
23 cents in New York for copper which cost 18 in London;
in 1879, 17.5 for what cost 12.2 in London; in 1880, 20 for
what cost 13.5 in London. Indeed, importers and manufacturers
had at times been able to buy American copper in
London so much cheaper than at home that it had paid them
to buy it there and send it here. (It came in duty-free if
proved to be an American product.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Nor were the high protectionists even in steel and iron
without opposition from men who, like them, profited from
the growth of iron and steel industries. Mr. Abram S. Hewitt
of New York, for instance, declared that from his point of
view the duties were altogether too high, profits unfairly
large. In speaking of steel profits he said: “I have never
known any such profits in connection with anything with
which I have had anything to do;” a statement which
confirmed everything which could be learned about the carefully
concealed profits of that industry—for instance, not
long before this in a law-suit involving the estate of J. Edgar
Thompson, the fact had been brought out that he had received
as high as 77 per cent per annum as dividends on his
steel holdings.</p>

<p class='c007'>A sinister phase of the testimony was the recurrence of
the word monopoly. The theory of Mr. Kelley and his
kind had been, of course, that when in consequence of high
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>protection the manufacturing of an article became profitable,
capital rushed in to take advantage, and such competition
resulted that prices eventually fell lower than they were
abroad. But it was not working that way. In the steel and
iron business, for instance, as soon as prices began to go
down from interior competition a combination to keep them
up resulted. It was even shown in the hearings that in 1878
the Vulcan Works of St. Louis had been paid to shut down.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was October when the commission terminated its public
hearings and settled down to prepare its reports. The scrappiness
of the testimony, the evident absorption of the majority
of the witnesses in their own interests and not those of the
country, the little attention given to commerce and the
consumer, the failure to get anything like exact statistics,
created the impression that nothing important would result.
A bad impression was made on the public, too, by the flock of
individuals which everywhere hovered around the commission
apparently to say to it privately what they did not care to say
on the witness stand. These persons beset the members as
they dined, walked, rode across country in their special train.
They invited them to dinner and to the theatres—a horde
of hungry duty-hunters who did more to demonstrate to
the fair-minded members of the commission the peculiar
evils inherent in any protective system than reams of the
ablest theoretical teaching could have done.</p>

<p class='c007'>The report was submitted to Congress in December, and
its publication was a surprise all around. It was far more
intelligent, far-reaching, and disinterested than a cynical
public had expected. Poor Mr. Henry Carey Baird, the
quinine-makers, the whole band of duty-grabbers, were in
dismay. They had been betrayed, they said, and it was
young Mr. Porter who had done it. He was an Englishman.
It was evident he was an emissary of British free traders, sent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>over by them as a boy to be educated for the task of undermining
American prosperity.</p>

<p class='c007'>No tariff reformer indeed could have asked a better platform
than that on which the Commissioners claimed they had
worked. Early in their deliberations, they said, they had
come to the conclusion that a substantial reduction was
demanded—that it was necessary for general industrial
prosperity. “<i>No rates of defensive duties</i>,” declared the
commission, “<i>except for the establishment of new industries
which more than equalize the conditions of labor and capital
with those of foreign competitors, can be justified.</i> Excessive
duties, or those above such standard of equalization, are
positively injurious to the interest which they are supposed to
benefit.” They encourage “rash and unskilled speculation”
to go into business, they “discredit our whole national economic
system,” they cause “uncertainty,” destroy the “sense
of stability required for extended undertakings.” No such
“extraordinary stimulus” as the war taxes gave was now
necessary. The great improvements in machinery and
processes made in twenty years “would permit our manufacturers
to compete with their foreign rivals under a substantial
reduction of existing duties.” Twenty per cent was the
general reduction which they had decided manufacturing
could support, and they estimated that the changes they proposed
would produce a reduction of fully 25 per cent.</p>

<p class='c007'>When one came to examine in detail the schedules proposed
by the commission, it was apparent that, however good
their platform, they had by no means lived up to it. The
changes were marked by many inconsistencies. The duty on
chemicals was cut down with rigor, and quinine was left on
the free list, but the duty on crockery and glass was raised
without presenting any satisfactory proof that the conditions
of labor and capital required an advance. The duty on steel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>rails was dropped from $28.00 to $18.00—which was still
prohibitive—and raised on steel blooms. The copper duty
was reduced 20 per cent; nickel 16⅔ per cent; pig iron
<i>4 per cent</i>. The duty on iron rods, cotton-ties, and many
manufactures of iron were raised 50 and more per cent.</p>

<p class='c007'>The singular inconsistencies apart, however, there was
enough of what was practical, sound, and helpful in the report
to make it an admirable basis to work on. The most serious
question seemed to be whether those who had created the
commission would stand by its findings. Would the Industrial
League consent to a 25 per cent reduction? Would
the horde of individuals who had beset the commission
during its labors keep their hands off? Would Congress
accept and act upon it in the same spirit and with the same
intelligence as had been bestowed on its preparation? That
it intended to act upon it was obvious. The report was immediately
referred to the proper committees in both House
and Senate, with orders to prepare bills. Haste was necessary.
The last election had gone against the Republicans,
the House after March 4th would be Democratic. If the
tariff was to be revised by its friends, they must act quickly.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V<br /> <span class='large'>THE MONGREL BILL OF 1883</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In a message sent to Congress in December, 1882, President
Arthur said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>The present tariff system is in many ways unjust. It makes
unequal distributions both of its burdens and benefits.... I
recommend an enlargement of the free list so as to include within
it the numerous articles which yield inconsiderable revenue, a
simplification of the complex and inconsistent schedule of duties
upon certain manufactures, particularly those of cotton, iron,
and steel and a substantial reduction of the duties upon those
articles and upon sugar, molasses, silk, wool, and woollen goods.</i>”</p>

<p class='c007'>The words had unusual weight, for Arthur was the only
President we have had who could speak from a practical
experience in administering the customs. For seven years
(1871 to 1878) he had been Collector of the Port of New York.
It was at a time when the Custom House was undergoing a
series of rude shocks, the combined results of the ambiguities
of the tariff laws, the greed of importers, the dishonesty of
some of its officials, and the “pernicious activity” in politics
of others. Arthur had been obliged to fight for the honor of
his own administration, and he had finally been suspended by
President Hayes. That is, President Arthur knew much from
close contact of the ambiguities, the frauds, the injustice
of the duties then in force, so that any expression of his had
the merit of being “practical.” It had additional force,
because nobody could doubt Arthur’s devotion to protection.
He had been from boyhood a “Henry Clay Whig.” Everybody
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>recognized that nothing but a profound conviction that
the country demanded lower duties would have driven him
to ask for them. The country indeed had not long before
this given the Republicans a stern rebuke on its tariff policy
by electing a good-sized Democratic majority to the House
in the next Congress—the forty-eighth, meeting in December,
1883.</p>

<p class='c007'>Spurred to action by Arthur’s message, the report of the
Tariff Commission, and by their own defeat, the Republicans
lost no time in getting to work. The report of the Tariff
Commission was sent at once to the Committee of Ways
and Means in the House and to the Finance Committee in
the Senate, and both bodies began to frame bills. Under
ordinary circumstances, the Senate would have been obliged
to wait for a bill from the House before expressing itself,—the
House alone having the right to originate revenue bills,—but
the circumstances were not “ordinary.” The Senate
at this moment had before it a bill for reducing the internal
revenue. This bill had come from the House in the preceding
session and had only been kept from becoming a law by the
filibustering of certain Democratic Senators. It was somebody’s
bright idea now to tack to this internal revenue bill,
as an amendment, a tariff bill of the Senate’s own making.
It was, of course, an adventure of uncertain issue. The
House was notoriously jealous of its constitutional rights.
Would it recognize a measure proposed by the Senate? The
Senate thought it worth the trial at least, and fell to work.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two committees which at opposite ends of the Capitol
now began to sit daily over the tariff were remarkable bodies.
At the head of the Senate committee was Mr. Morrill, who
twenty-three years before had introduced into the House of
Representatives the bill with which this narrative opened.
Since 1867 he had been a member of the Senate, giving the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>bulk of his time to revenue questions. He was seventy-two
years old now, and in spite of over twenty years’ labor on
tariff schedules was still dignified and courteous!</p>

<p class='c007'>John Sherman was next to Morrill on the Committee—a
place he held with bad grace. Sherman had lost his rank
on the Committee of Finance, of which he had formerly been
chairman, by his appointment to Mr. Hayes’s cabinet in
1876, it being an invariable rule that a member returning
to the Senate after an interregnum should go to the foot of
his party colleagues on committee. When Sherman returned
in 1881 he thought he should be an exception to the rule. He
had up to this time outranked Mr. Morrill in both House and
Senate. His services as Secretary of the Treasury had given
him special skill in dealing with revenue questions. But
Mr. Morrill declined to yield. It looked as if Mr. Sherman
would sit at the foot of the table, when Mr. Allison, who was
a member of the Committee, appreciating the strain, quietly
suggested to his Republican colleagues that Mr. Sherman be
moved up next to Morrill. This was done, but from the beginning
of the work on the bill the effect of his defeat was most
noticeable on Sherman’s temper and attitude. He was arrogant
in committee and out. He says in his “Recollections”
that he was “piqued” by Morrill’s failure to yield to him.
The word is mild.</p>

<p class='c007'>It began to be noticed soon after the Committee went to
work that Mr. Sherman was getting much help from the
member at the foot—a new Senator, the Senator from
Rhode Island—Nelson W. Aldrich. People who watched
the hearings said he seemed to have at his tongue’s end all the
facts which bore on the high tariff side. It was said on the
inside, too, that he was the man who had written the cotton
schedule for the report of the Tariff Commission. He had
certainly done well for his constituents. He had secured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>an increase on that class of cotton goods which was chiefly
imported, and a decrease on those of which little or nothing
could be imported.</p>

<p class='c007'>The leading Democrat on the Committee was James
B. Beck of Lexington, Kentucky. Beck was a Scotchman
by birth and a Democrat of eighteen years’ Congressional
experience. Powerful in body and mind, brave, honest, and
combative, he led his party in the Senate with great effectiveness.
It was on the tariff that Beck was at his best. Let him
get after a rate he regarded as iniquitous and he was like an
avalanche. “His mighty arms swing like hammers,” wrote
an English correspondent who heard him once on that theme.
“His Scotch tongue, which some call harsh and rasping,
thunders out the shortest and simplest Anglo-Saxon words
that can be found to compose his terse sentences. Now and
then the clinched fist comes down on his desk with telling
force. The whole speech is made up of facts and statistics.
If a flower of rhetoric should spring up in his path he would
crush it with his ponderous foot. If a trope should get into
his throat, he would swallow it. Adjectives, metaphors, and
similes find no place in his oratory. Like Joseph Hume, he
is a man of figures, and like him he speaks like a problem
in mathematics.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The House Committee was strong on both sides. The
chairman was “Pig Iron” Kelley, who, in spite of twenty-five
years’ experience with protection, still found it an “exquisite
harmony.” He had as supporters the experienced Mr.
Kasson of Iowa and the devoted young Mr. McKinley of
Ohio, but it was on neither of them he was depending chiefly.
There had been put on the Committee in the previous session
a man from Kansas, Dudley C. Haskell, who was now to
take about the same relation to Kelley as Kelley had taken
to Thaddeus Stevens in the tariff debate of 1866 and 1867.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>The Democrats of the Committee were four of the strongest
that Congress has seen since the war—Carlisle of Kentucky,
Randall of Pennyslvania, Morrison of Illinois, and Tucker of
Virginia.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here, then, were two able committees giving their entire
time to tariff bills. They were under instructions from a
Republican country and a Republican President to lower
the duties, and they had as a guide a report of a Republican
commission of their own creation advising its reduction.
They had Republican majorities to back them. Their
duty seemed plain. It seemed clear, too, that they should
be free from outside pressure. All of those individuals
whose interests were affected had had ample opportunities
to lay their cases before a commission constituted for the
purpose. To keep away from Washington would seem to
be their obvious business. But they saw it differently.
Indeed, the two committees had scarcely gone to work before
a “third house” was in session—a house of lobbyists come
to Washington for the express purpose of preventing the
recommendations of the Tariff Commission from becoming
law. The wool-growers, disgusted that Mr. Garland, representing
them on the commission, had consented to nearly
20 per cent reduction, held public meetings in Ohio denouncing
him, and sent down what scoffers called the “wool trinity”—Columbus
Delano, one-time Secretary of the Interior under
Grant, William Lawrence, afterward a Comptroller of the
Treasury, and David Harpster—all wool-growers and all
from Ohio.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. John L. Hayes, chairman of the Tariff Commission,
whose duties naturally would be supposed to be over, took
rooms in Washington and as agent of the woollen manufacturers
began a campaign to get more for them than as
commissioner he had consented to. The makers of chemicals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>and drugs—and quinine particularly—instituted a siege.
Agents of iron and steel, sugar, mineral water, wood pulp, of
everything which had suffered a reduction, appeared in the
corridors of the Capitol at Washington. “No such lobby
has been seen here for years,” the correspondents began to
write to their newspapers. These agents, attorneys, manufacturers,
did not hesitate to say loudly that no bill should
pass unsatisfactory to them. They were far from standing
together, however, in their demands. Indeed, they were in
incessant conflict, for they all wanted what they purchased—that
is, their raw material—free; while what they sold—their
product—they wanted protected! In every industry
came this clash, though it was more acute between the wool
and woollen men than elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first bill to come out of committee was that of the
Senate. It was at once seen that the duties proposed were in
many cases <i>lower</i> than those proposed by the Tariff Commission.
For instance: the Tariff Commission had laid
$6.72 duty on pig iron, a reduction of only 4 per cent.
The Senate Committee, after going over the whole ground,
had cut the rate to $6.00. Mr. Sherman had fought the
decrease in the committee; he continued to fight it on the
floor. He tried for $6.72 and was voted down overwhelmingly.
He tried for $6.50 and again was beaten. He
argued, threatened, cajoled. He read telegrams from the
iron men of his state, brought in letters and testimony,
worked day and night, but it took him over a month to
succeed, and then it was only, as Beck said, after “he had
threatened the Senate with the defeat of the whole bill if
they did not give him at least $6.50 on pig iron, and after
he had drawn the party whip over the heads of his followers
with an audacity I have never seen equalled in any public
assembly, by threats and every other means that a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>bold parliamentary leader can assert over the men who look
up to him.” Beck was none too hard on Sherman. He
beat his party into submission, but it should not be forgotten
that the lash was on his own shoulder—the lash of Henry
B. Payne of Cleveland, of the ironmasters of the Mahoning
Valley, of all the highly organized iron interests of his state.
He knew only too well what failure to accede to their demand
meant for the party in Ohio, for they did not hesitate to tell
him privately and publicly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sherman fought for an increased rate on wool as he did for
one on pig iron. He was as hard pressed in one case as
the other. The fight caused more than one hard and open
tilt between him and his Republican colleagues, particularly
with Allison, who disapproved a higher tariff on wool. Sherman
was determined, however, and again and again returned
to the attack with threats of defeating the entire bill if he
could not have his way.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Mr. Sherman was not the only Senator who openly held
up the party for duties higher than the majority of his colleagues
approved of. The Senators of Maine, Michigan, and
Wisconsin fought for duty on lumber in the same way. The
Tariff Commission had not changed the duties on lumber.
It left them as they were without a word of explanation.
Better so; for a more indefensible tax than that on lumber
could not be conceived. It had already helped work a destruction
which a hundred years could not repair, and its continuance
seemed little less than crime. The duty on sawed
boards was $1.00 and $2.00 per one thousand feet, according
to variety. Under this protection, combined with the enormous
demand which the growth of the country had created,
the cutting of timber had been carried on recklessly and lawlessly,
particularly in Wisconsin and Michigan. Ten years
before, in 1873, the danger of exhausting the forests beyond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>repair had been shown and Congress had passed the Timber
Culture Act to encourage planting; but while it gave a
bonus for planting on one hand, it continued the bonus for
cutting on the other. Pine in particular was being stripped
off. A Federal Commission had just issued a report showing
that there was only about 81,000,000,000 feet of white
pine standing in the three principal states—enough for
ten years only. The duty, combined with the knowledge
that the supply was limited, kept prices so high that in the
“treeless states,” like Nebraska and Kansas, new settlers
were in great distress. From all over the West, indeed,
came the cry for relief. People were living in dugouts, because
of this tax, the Western Senators and Representatives
told Congress. Their cattle had no shelter, their fodder
was covered only with a thatch. What made the tax more
vicious was the well known fact that the forests were largely
in the hands of the “lumber barons,” men who had in
one way or another secured vast tracts of land at from
$1.25 to $2.50 an acre and who now were gathering in
$8.00 or more an acre by unrestricted cutting of the timber.
The Senate of the United States numbered one of
the greatest of these barons—Philetus Sawyer, Esq., of
Wisconsin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Naturally it was not the interests of Mr. Sawyer which the
timber Senators pleaded! It was the cause of the lumbermen
and of the millmen. The tariff must be kept up in order to
give them their higher wage. They must not be put into
competition with the pauper wages of Canada! As a large
percentage of the laborers who received this higher wage
were Canadians who came over for the season only, the argument
had little effect. It was not argument indeed that
saved the lumber duty. It was saved because the Southern
Representatives who threatened to defeat it were told they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>could not have a duty on sugar unless they consented to one
on lumber, and they made the trade.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such barter went on openly in many other items. One of
the most determined efforts to force a duty was made by
Senator Mahone of Virginia, who wanted $2.00 a ton on iron
ore. The Tariff Commission had allowed 50 cents—the
Senate Committee had allowed 50 cents, but Mahone made
a fierce fight for more. He tried for $2.00, for $1.00, for 85
cents, for 75 cents, for 60 cents. He brought up the point
at every opportunity, but again and again was voted down
overwhelmingly. “I’ll defeat the bill if this duty is not
raised,” he is reported as saying, and Sherman backed
him in his threat.</p>

<p class='c007'>His attitude was the attitude of the representatives of
various other interests, big and little; that is, it developed
almost as soon as the debate began that leading Republican
Senators were determined to keep up duties in which certain
of their constituents were interested and that to do this they
were ready to trade and dicker with fellow Senators. That
this determination of Sherman, Mahone, and others was
clearly demonstrated was due largely to the quick wit and
the daring of Mr. Beck. He filibustered so adroitly from the
beginning of the contest over the schedules that again and
again he forced Republicans committed to tariff reform to go
on record against a proposed reduction or for a proposed increase.
In Sherman’s struggle for the increased duty on
pig iron, Senators like Morrill, Allison, Dawes, Frye, Hoar,
Hale, Hawley, all voted against an increase at first, but
finally were whipped into line, Allison being the last to yield.
Mr. Beck gloated over them, loudly pointing out how different
ones had solemnly declared on the floor they would not support
the increase, yet had yielded at last. Nothing could
stop him. An effort was made to limit the debate to ten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>days. “Never!” shouted Beck, “not to ten weeks.” Not
even the effort of his party to put an end to his obstruction
availed. He gloried in his insubordination.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the 20th of February before the Senate Bill was
passed. Two weeks before this the bill had taken on an
importance quite unexpected. This change was due to the
growing certainty that the House was not going to be able to
finish its bill and that if a tariff bill was passed this session,
it would be the measure on which the Senate was working.
No sooner did this rumor go out than the whole body of lobbyists,
whose work up to this time had been concentrated on the
House, rushed pell-mell to the corridors of the Senate to see
what they could do to make the measure “satisfactory”
before it was reported. Some of the things they helped to
do have already been alluded to.</p>

<p class='c007'>The House Bill was having a hard time. The Committee,
instead of following the Tariff Commission report and reducing
duties 20 per cent, had reduced them less than 10 per
cent. Now there was no doubt but that a majority of the
Republicans in the House were in favor of real reform. Most
of them declared they dared not go home without a reduction of
taxes. But there was a powerful Republican minority who
believed with Senator Sherman that it was more essential
to satisfy the combined industrial organizations besieging the
Capitol than it was to satisfy public opinion. This minority
was determined no bill which gave anything like a 20 per cent
reduction should pass. It is not unfair to say that it wanted
a bill, but <i>a bill which gave the appearance of reduction, not
actual reduction</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Democrats, too, were divided. John G. Carlisle, who
led the majority, was what may be called a constructive
free trader; that is, he believed in scaling down duties as
rapidly as industries enjoying them could support it, until
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>a ‘tariff-for-revenue only’ basis was reached. He declared
now that if the Republicans had presented a bill which
sincerely attempted to embody the reduction of 20 per cent
suggested by their commission and demanded by public
opinion, he would favor its passage, but Kelley’s bill he
would not support. Randall, who led the Democratic minority,
was a high protectionist, but Randall was really willing
to support any bill which promised to get the tariff out of the
way. He expected to be a candidate for Speaker at the opening
of the next Congress and did not want to divide his party
by supporting protection in opposition to the Democratic
majority.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the very beginning of the debate on the bill it became
evident that each faction was ready to fight strenuously
to carry out its program. The Carlisle Democrats began
by bringing to issue almost every item as it was read. They
made amendments, debated them, forced them to vote by
voice, by rising divisions, and by tellers, and they openly
declared that they would keep this up until the Fourth of
March rather than allow Mr. Kelley’s bill to come to vote.
Their tactics indeed were very like those Mr. Beck was using in
the Senate and their effect was identical; that is, they constantly
forced the Republicans to put themselves on record
against lowering duties. Not infrequently they were aided
in their work of obstruction by revenue reform Republicans,
particularly from the West, where the tariff on lumber and
an increased duty on barbed wire were causing indignation.</p>

<p class='c007'>So strong a program of opposition was developed that in
ten days after the discussion opened it became evident that if
any bill was passed it would be because the high protection
faction yielded to the demands of the majority of the party
for a reduction or that they carried their program by superior
parliamentary tactics. That they were in strong position
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>for the latter everybody saw. As a fact they held all the
strategic positions: the speakership, the chairmanship, and
a majority of the Ways and Means Committee, and of the
Committee on Rules. For the moment, however, the work
was all in the hands of Chairman Kelley and his lieutenants.
Mr. Kelley had been ill from the beginning of the session and
he had asked Mr. Haskell to take charge of the bill on the floor.
A more sympathetic and vigorous understudy than Haskell,
Kelley could not have had. He was a man only forty years
old, a powerful individual, over six feet high, with a voice
as big as his body, and with the face and eyes of an evangelist.
His earnestness for a cause he had espoused was almost
tragic in its intensity, and forced him to work and fight for
it passionately and untiringly. Two subjects had occupied
him so far in the six years he had been in Congress, polygamy
and protection. He hated the first as he revered the
second. Indeed, for Haskell protection was as complete a
solution of all economic difficulties as it was for Kelley, and
he had the same fanatical devotion to the doctrine. The only
question he asked himself in making a tariff bill was whether
an article could or could not be raised in this country. If it
could not, he would put it on the free list. If it could, he
would protect it beyond the possibility of foreign competition.
Of course, this reduced his labor to finding out how much each
article needed to be put beyond competition. This was a
matter of fact. As soon as he was put on the Committee of
Ways and Means, which was at the opening of the 47th
Congress, he went to work with unparalleled industry to
master the conditions of each article. He became a veritable
encyclopædia of information on the “needs” of industries.
When the work on the bill of 1883 began, he doubled his
efforts. His days he spent in committee and in the House,
his nights receiving representatives of all sorts of industries.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>The facts and figures they gave him he attached in long
festoons to copies of the bills which he was making ready for
the debate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Convinced as Kelley and Haskell were of the perfection of
their doctrine, it was not to be wondered at that they looked
on the Democratic opposition to the duties they were trying to
carry through as outright filibustering or that they were willing
to lend themselves to almost any manœuvres which would
thwart it. Their first move was to try to stop debate. The
attempt threw the Democrats into violent excitement, for so
far only two out of sixteen schedules had been considered. It
was an effort to gag the House, they declared. “Such a
proposition,” said Mr. Carlisle, “has never been heard of in
the parliamentary history of this country, a proposition to
destroy  the freedom of debate on a bill to raise revenue.”
“Stop your filibustering then,” was the gist of Mr. Haskell’s
retort. “Never under gag rule,” retorted Mr. Carlisle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The failure of this attempt to get his bill to vote discouraged
Kelley, and it began to be rumored that he and his colleagues
were going to drop it and go to the country with the charge
that the Democrats had killed it by obstruction. The rumor
reached the White House and Arthur let it be known that if
Congress failed to pass a bill he should call them in extra
session.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dilemma was a serious one for Mr. Kelley. It was
evident that the Democrats would never allow his bill
to come to vote unless its duties were materially reduced.
He could never consent to that. But the President demanded
a bill of some kind, would call an extra session to
get it if necessary. The only hope seemed in the Senate bill,
which was already fairly advanced and which Kelley knew
would soon be reported. But this Senate bill did not
suit him at all. Its duties he saw were bound to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>considerably lower than those recommended by the Tariff
Commission. Supposing that he waived the constitutional
objection to a revenue bill originating in the Senate and let
it come before the House, was there any method by which he
could make it suit his notion before it came to vote?
The question was a difficult one, and for the moment there
seemed no answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>As day by day passed and nothing was done, irritation and
uncertainty grew on both sides. Only the lobby rejoiced.
There would be no reduction after all! But they did not
reduce their pressure. Indeed it increased rather. The iron
and steel men called down Commissioner Oliver. The
mineral water men stirred up their attorney, Roscoe Conkling.
Every interest engaged the highest-sounding names it could
secure for a final day and night attack.</p>

<p class='c007'>The effect of all this on the two chambers was deplorable.
Particularly in the House did the debate lose all semblance of
sincerity and order. Again and again it was broken up by
charges and counter-charges—by contradictions, appeals to
the Speaker, cries of “Hear, hear!” “Order, order!” “Rule,
rule!” The Democrats, gloating over the apparent predicament
of the Republicans, taunted them repeatedly with not
intending to pass a bill—charges which maddened Mr. Haskell
especially. One day when these taunts were unusually
sharp, Haskell lost control of himself. Towering like a giant,
his face white as a sheet, he shouted, “We will see who wants
reduction! We will see who are the obstructionists. I move
that the committee rise”—a motion intended to close debate
on the bill. The Democrats almost as a body were on
their feet at once, rushing down the aisles, dragging in members
from committee rooms, haranguing on gag rule. A long
and acrimonious debate followed, but as before, the attempt
to close debate failed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Another day, when both sides were heated and bitter,
Townshend of Illinois declared that the bill of the Ways and
Means Committee did not originate in Congress at all, but
was “sired by a lobby of hired agents of monopoly and was
brought forth in a secret conclave unknown to the rules of
the House.” Mr. Haskell’s wrath was terrible. “Every
word of his declaration is a scandalous falsehood,” he thundered.
There was confusion on both sides for a moment but
the friends of the two calmed them down. The next morning,
however, Mr. Morrison waited on Mr. Haskell at his
boarding house on Eighth Street with a peremptory
demand that Mr. Haskell make public retraction of his
offensive utterance or he, Mr. Morrison, would feel obliged to
request Mr. Haskell to name some gentleman to confer concerning
further remedies for his friend’s wounded honor.
Mr. Haskell laughed at the idea of a duel, but he assured Mr.
Morrison that so long as Mr. Townshend’s statement stood
on record, his assertion of its falsehood would stand against
it. And there the matter remained.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such was the temper of the House when the Senate bill
reached it on February 20—a poor temper indeed for candid
legislation. Nevertheless, the bill could probably have
been passed promptly if Mr. Kelley had been willing. The
Carlisle Democrats criticised it, but they declared it too
good to obstruct. As for the majority of Republicans,
they were in favor of it. But Mr. Kelley was not willing.
His first business then was to block any attempt to get the
bill off the Speaker’s table and pass it by a regular procedure;
a thing not difficult to do, for Speaker Keifer was playing
perfectly into his hands and could be depended upon not to
recognize anybody whom Kelley and Haskell were unwilling
should get a hearing. Indeed, the Democrats had been saying
for days that nobody could catch the Speaker’s eye unless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>Kelley first gave the wink. In this matter of keeping back
the bill so small a matter as a misplaced semicolon aided
Kelley materially. In looking over the engrossed copy sent
to the House from the Senate, Mr. Haskell had discovered
one which considerably changed duties on iron. He would
not consider a bill so “ragged, ill-considered, and half made,”
he declared. The poor little semicolon held up the House and
gave half the papers in the country a subject for editorials.
The Senate clerk hastened over to correct the error. It was
only a slip. He could easily remedy it, he urged. “No,”
said Speaker Keifer sternly. He was not going to allow a
Senate clerk to make a tariff bill for them. The bill had to be
taken back to the Senate and corrected by proper procedure.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the semicolon and other small matters were taking
up time the Republican leaders were closeted with the Committee
on Rules, which they controlled, in an effort to find
a way out of their dilemma. If they could get the bill into
a conference of their own kind and revise it and then pass
it, they would be satisfied. It all amounted, as a matter of
fact, to finding a way to defeat a bill which the majority
would accept and to make and pass one which the minority
wanted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now in anticipation of the difficulty in which they expected
to be when the Senate bill reached them, Mr. Kasson had some
days before this proposed a revision of the House rules which
would allow a majority to take the Senate bill from the table
to concur in, or to non-concur in, and send to a conference.
If Mr. Kelley could have been sure of a majority for nonconcurrence
he would have risked this procedure, but he
found he could not. In caucus and out he canvassed
the Republicans and always with the result that he feared
a vote would result in concurrence. He was afraid of the
Kasson rule.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>It was certainly not an easy problem, but it was solved, and
the man to solve it was a member of the Committee on Rules,
Thomas B. Reed of Maine. Reed had been six years in the
House and in this time had shown himself an excellent debater
and parliamentarian. On the tariff he was sound enough to
suit Mr. Kelley and “practical” enough to suit Mr. Sherman.
From his point of view it was idle to discuss the matter.
Protection, he said, was the accepted doctrine of the country—a
closed question. His business was to get what his constituents
wanted. His remarks on the lumber tariff and its relation
to forest preservation show his general attitude. “I
want to know why this country should preserve my forest
for the benefit of some other gentleman? I should like to
know why the principal industry of the State of Maine should
be destroyed because the gentleman from Illinois thinks that
his state needs a more humid atmosphere? Why, sir, the
very purpose of forests in the course of nature is to be cut
down and have houses built of them.... I tell you each
generation can take care of itself, each generation is sufficient
unto itself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The rule Mr. Reed now proposed for extracting the high
protectionists was an admirable introduction to his later
career as a parliamentarian. It ran as follows:</p>

<p class='c012'>“That during the remainder of this session it shall be in order
at any time to move to suspend the rules, which motion shall be
decided by a majority vote, to take from the Speaker’s table House
Bill No. 5538, with the Senate amendment thereto, entitled a bill
to Reduce Internal Revenue Taxation, and to declare a disagreement
with the Senate amendment to the same, and to ask for a committee
of conference thereon, to be composed of five members on
the part of the House. If such motion shall fail, the bill shall
remain on the Speaker’s table unaffected by the decision of the
House on said motion.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>It was a rule which allowed the House to declare a disagreement
but not an agreement. It allowed a majority to non-concur,
but forbade it to concur! A New York <cite>Herald</cite>
correspondent characterized Mr. Reed’s rule perfectly when
he declared that it realized the Irishman’s dream of a gun
which should fire so as to hit the object if it was a deer and
miss it if it was a cow! It was on Saturday, the 24th of
February, that Mr. Reed reported his rule, and on Monday
it was taken up. Only seven days then remained of the
session. The storm which burst over the rule when it was
read on Monday was quite worthy of its audacity. It was a
“monstrous proposition,” said Mr. Carlisle. “It is a fraud
on parliamentary law; a fraud on all that is just and fair
in our politics; it is revolutionary,” said Mr. Cox. Mr. Reed
listened placidly to it all and finally closed the discussion by
declaring coolly that he himself considered the procedure
he was introducing as “forcible,” that he should never be in
favor of such a rule save in a “great emergency,” but that such
an emergency he considered to be at hand. The country
demanded a revision. The Democrats had defeated the
House bill by a systematic course of obstruction. The Senate
bill was not satisfactory to business men; it was unconstitutional
to adopt it, but something must be done to relieve
distress. There was nothing to do but revise the Senate
bill “in the quiet of a conference committee.” The rule
was adopted after nearly a day’s debate by a vote of 129 to 22.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the Democrats were not through yet. They raised
the constitutional question—was the House of Representatives
to waive its right to originate revenue measures?
Never. The discussion precipitated lacked sincerity, for
leading Democrats had already testified to their willingness
to let the Senate bill go through as it stood. Mr. Haskell
finally stopped debates by a resolution which was carried.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>It turned the constitutional question over to the Tariff Conference
for decision. The manœuvre was adroit. It simply
meant that if the Tariff Conference did not result satisfactorily
to the high protectionist members, they had the plea of unconstitutionality
to fall back on, or as somebody put it,
“If pig-iron goes up, the amendment of the Senate will be constitutional;
if pig-iron goes down, it will be unconstitutional.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was late on Tuesday, the 28th day of February, before
finally things were adjusted, and the conferees appointed by
both House and Senate. The appointments precipitated
another tangle. As was to have been expected, Speaker
Keifer appointed a high protectionist committee—packed
it, moderate Republicans, who were not represented at all,
said. Mr. Randall, who was one of the two Democratic appointments,
felt so badly about the make-up that he refused
to serve. This tangle was straightened out, and finally on
the evening of the 28th the conferees had their first meeting.
Among those from the Senate were Beck and Bayard. They
were disturbed by the idea that the conference might
not be “full and free,”—that is, that the constitutional
question might be raised,—and when they found they could
get no assurance to the contrary they withdrew. Ten different
Senators were appointed before two could be found to
accept! These were Mahone and McDill, both Republicans!</p>

<p class='c007'>When the Committee was finally under way it made quick
work of revision—as indeed it could do, having a powerful
high protection majority. There were sharp contests—more
than once rumors ran up and down the Capitol, where for
the last few days all Washington had congregated, watching
developments, that the conference would fail because Sherman
was not getting his desired increase on wool or because Morrill
was failing in his efforts to keep down the rate on pig-iron.
The tension the uncertainty caused was broken at noon on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>March 2, when Mr. Morrill entered the Senate and said:
“I desire to ask unanimous consent for the printing of the
report of the Conference Committee.” It was granted and
at nine o’clock that evening the printed report was before
the Senate. Of course everybody turned at once to the items
over which the great struggles had come. Had Sherman
secured his rate on pig-iron and wool, Mahone on iron ore,
Kelley on steel and quinine and nickel, the Louisiana
planters on sugar?</p>

<p class='c007'>The most cursory examination showed that the high protectionists
had got much that they asked. Iron ore had been
raised to 75 cents a ton after having been given 50 by tariff
commission, by House, and by Senate. Pig-iron was restored
to $6.72; steel rails, after having been given $15.68 in the
Senate and $15.00 in House, were raised to $17.00. Mr.
Beck attacked the bill violently, making a most imposing
array of duties raised, but of course saying nothing of those
lowered! At the same time he attacked Sherman for his
part in raising duties. Sherman was not jubilant, however,
over what he had done. Indeed, he was almost in despair.
For if he had succeeded in the metal schedule, he had failed
in the wool. The wool bill of 1867 had put compound duties
on wool—10 cents a pound and 11 per cent ad valorem on all
wools costing 32 or less cents a pound; 12 cents a pound and
10 per cent ad valorem on all costing over 32 cents. The ad valorems
were dropped in the bill of ’83. The rate on carpet wool
was also lowered. The duties on manufactured goods were
lowered less on the whole than those on raw wool. In the
bill of ’67 the manufacturer had been allowed a specific duty
of 50 cents to compensate him for the duty on wool and dyestuffs;
this was dropped to 35 cents in the bill of ’83; but
on several grades of woollens the ad valorem duty was raised.
It was raised indeed in every case where importations were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>large. On cheap goods the duties were so high there could
be no competition; indeed they could have been lowered considerably
and the situation remained unchanged. But wool-growers
and wool manufacturers were both incensed at the
bill. Senator Sherman took his failure much to heart and
he refused to sign the conference report. It was a question if
he would vote for the bill. But when the matter came to a
test, as it did about midnight of Saturday, March 3, he
voted yea.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have always regretted,” Mr. Sherman wrote twelve
years later, “that I did not defeat the bill, which I could
have readily done by voting with the Democrats against
the adoption of the conference report, which passed the
Senate by the vote of yeas 32, nays 30. However, the
propriety and necessity of a reduction of internal taxes
proposed by the bill were so urgent that I did not feel
justified in denying relief from burdensome and unnecessary
taxes on account of provisions in the bill that I did not
approve. With great reluctance I voted for it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not until about noon of Saturday that Mr. Kelley,
pale from fatigue and suffering, presented the report. The
House was in a state of the greatest confusion at the time,
the galleries crowded with visitors, many of whom were
women, the corridors alive with excited lobbyists, the floor
in disorder from the running to and fro of Democrats, still
bent on obstruction, and of moderate Republicans anxious
but hardly daring to defeat the report. Such was the din that
Mr. Kelley could not be heard when he tried to read a statement
showing the changes the conference had made. The Democrats
would have none of his statements—they wanted the
whole report, schedules and all, and so the worn-out clerk
was called to read the entire document.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two hours were then allowed for debate. Mr. Carlisle criticised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>the bill in sober and dignified language, his chief point
being that the bill did not, could not produce the decrease
Mr. Kelley claimed for it—that it was for that reason a
deception. Others of his side were violent over the increases;
many sarcastic over the acceptance of a Senate measure.
“They have swapped the Constitution for a high tariff,”
declared Mr. Tucker. But the criticism of Mr. Carlisle and
his friends was not so severe as that of those high protectionists
who had failed to get the increase they asked, particularly
of the supporters of higher duties on wool. “I have voted
with the protectionists of Pennsylvania and with the protectionists
of New England,” complained Mr. Robison of
Ohio, “with the assurance—the most positive assurance—that
this great interest I represent should be taken care of,
... and you have stricken us down.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no doubt but that on the morning of the 3d there
was very real doubt about the report being adopted. The
moderate protectionists on the Republican side were against
it, and all conservative Republicans were disgusted with the
jugglery which had brought it through. A strong high
protectionist element, too, including Speaker Keifer, was
against it—but before four in the afternoon, when the debate
was to close, the tide turned. It was the pressure of the
country which did it. From one ocean to the other business
men commanded and implored over the wires that the bill
pass—good or bad. So many telegrams, it was said, had
never before been received in Washington. And so the bill
passed. And a few minutes before Congress adjourned it
was signed by President Arthur.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the time of its passage nobody knew what was in the
bill of 1883, such had been the juggling. But this was
certain, everybody but the persons who had saved their
duties was disgusted with it. Mr. Sherman went home to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>meet a political storm such as he had never met before—a
storm which forced him to explain and defend himself. It
was raised by the dissatisfied wool-growers. The Democrats
went out with the story of the barter and trickery which had
attended the measure. The Republicans everywhere were
obliged to defend themselves for doing or not doing. Dissatisfaction
was increased with the testing of the bill. It
did not produce the reduction promised either in internal
revenue or in customs. The bill went into operation July 1,
1883. In the first year of its operation it reduced duties only
about $20,000,000 (from $210,637,293 to $190,282,836).
The average reduction on iron and steel proved to be only
4.54 per cent; on clothing wool 10.73 per cent; on woollen
goods 1.01 per cent. On many articles there was an increase:
13.11 per cent on earthenware; 1.48 per cent on glassware;
2.54 per cent on cotton goods.</p>

<p class='c007'>But there were more serious features still. Mr. Sherman
says in his “Recollections” that the “Tariff law of 1883 laid
the foundation of all the Tariff complications since that time.”
The lack of “harmony” in duties, the failure to protect all
interests equally—wool and woollens, iron ore and pig-iron,
and their products—was what disturbed Mr. Sherman.
If we are to have protection, his view was, all must be protected.
“The dogma of free raw material is more dangerous
to the protective policy than the opposition of free-traders.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was something more serious than the failure to admit
the claims of all to protection. It was the semi-official
recognition of the organized business man in the making of
tariff schedules. True, they had been more or less active
in every bill since the war, but never before had their right
to stand day and night at the doors of Senate and House,
to sit in committee, to be closeted in every leisure hour with
their representatives in Congress, been conceded. It was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>recognition they were not likely to forget. Moreover it
was demonstrated clearly in 1883 that the size of the duty is
according to the size of the organization. The quinine-makers,
even with Mr. Kelley’s help, were unable to get their
product off the free list where it had been put in 1879, but
they were a feeble folk—only four of them in the country!
The pottery people, on the contrary, received an advance of
some 13 per cent on their wares, for they were strong in
Ohio and New Jersey. Mr. Joseph Wharton, standing alone,
had to submit to a reduction of 50 per cent on his nickel;
standing with iron men he suffered a reduction of only 4 per
cent on his pig-iron. It was a great lesson in the value of
organization and numbers.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <span class='large'>GROVER CLEVELAND AND THE TARIFF</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The most conspicuous political figures in the United States
in the fall of 1883 were two Democrats—John G. Carlisle
of Kentucky and Samuel J. Randall of Pennsylvania, rival
candidates for the Speakership of the House of Representatives.
Their contest was something more than a struggle for
leadership. A grave question was at stake. Should or should
not the Democrats open the tariff question? The Republicans
had passed a bill violating their own promises. It
was the second time in twenty-two years that they had broken
faith on the question. Mr. Carlisle claimed that the Democrats
should now make it their duty to effect the reforms so
long promised and every day more needed. Mr. Randall
claimed that the tariff should be left to the Republicans.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two men could scarcely have offered a greater contrast in
training, in methods, and in ideals than the two thus thrown
into prominence. Sam Randall was the older and by far the
more experienced in national affairs. For several years he
had been the leader of his party. He had accomplished this
mainly by the coolness and the skill with which he led a weak
minority so that it frequently was able to frustrate the plans
of a big majority. To play the parliamentarian game successfully
against such odds as Randall faced had aroused
enthusiasm and devotion and given him supreme power. The
first serious shock to Randall’s leadership came in the early
’80’s. Then the issue of tariff-for-revenue only became acute
with his party and he could not follow, for Randall was a protectionist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>of the Kelley brand. In youth he had been a
Whig, but in 1856 he and his family went over to Buchanan,
largely on the ground of personal liking, it seems. In Congress
he had always supported the high tariff arguments and
bills, without ever bringing much light to the question, for
he was not at all well equipped for tariff discussion. Indeed,
as late as the bill of 1883 he went about the House studying
a little handbook on the tariff—for the first time posting
himself on the vocabulary and the schedules. As it became
more evident that the Democratic issue was to be tariff
revision, Randall’s place became more difficult, for it was a
Republican district which was sending him to Congress and
it was no secret that they sent him on condition that he support
protection. To an outsider it seems now as if the
natural thing would have been for Randall to have gone over
to the Republicans at this juncture, but he believed, honestly
enough no doubt, that he could force the Democrats back from
the position they had taken, that he could in fact <i>protectionize</i>
the <i>Democratic Party</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Randall was dealing with a bigger force and a bigger
man in 1883 than he realized. John G. Carlisle, his opponent,
was probably the nearest approach to a statesman then in
the United States Congress. Born on a Kentucky farm, he
had spent the days of his early youth at farm work, the nights
over books. He had become a school teacher and in his
leisure had read law. Admitted to the bar, he had continued
to study until he was called the ablest lawyer in the state.
Admitted to the state legislature, he had become a leader of
his party by force of knowledge and intellectual vigor.
Carlisle had first entered the House in 1877, fourteen years
after Randall, and he immediately made a deep impression
on the country by his thorough mastery of subjects, his
clearness of statement, his gravity and candor in argument,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>and his freedom from the trickery and deceits of partisan
politics. In the spring of 1882 he made a speech against a
Tariff Commission which, as an argument for thorough
tariff reform, was one of the ablest of the period. It really
framed a strong logical position for the Democrats. His
speech in 1883 when the Kelley Bill was under consideration
gave his position in the tariff:</p>

<p class='c012'>“In the broad and sweeping sense which the term usually
implies I am not a free-trader,” he said. “I will add that in my
judgment it will be years yet before anything in the nature of
free trade would be wise or practicable in the United States.
When we speak of this subject we refer to approximate free trade
which has no idea of cutting the growth of home industries, but
simply of scaling down the inequalities of the tariff schedules where
they are utterly out of proportion to the demands of that growth.
After we have calmly stood up and allowed monopolists to grow
fat we should not be asked to make them bloated. Our enormous
surplus revenues are illogical and oppressive. It is entirely undemocratic
to continue these burdens on the people for years and
years after the requirements of protection have been met and the
representatives of these industries have become incrusted with
wealth.”</p>

<p class='c006'>That is, Carlisle saw clearly that certain evils inherent in
high protection, evils against which Garfield and all the Republican
tariff reformers had so often warned, were becoming
realities. The word monopoly was already in everybody’s
mouth, for at this time the impossibility of preventing the
over-production and consequent depressions which are the
logical results of an artificial stimulus like a high tariff, except
by some artificial check like a combination to limit output and
hold up prices, had been completely demonstrated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Randall, however, saw no danger in the building up of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>monopolies and combinations to limit production which
counterbalanced the advantage there was in shutting out
foreign competition and keeping the home market inviolate.
The danger he claimed to see was unsettling capital. “There
is nothing in life so sensitive to adverse criticism and which
takes alarm so quickly,” he said, “as capital invested in large
industrial enterprises.... Shall we unsettle business interests
by constant tinkering with the tariff? Shall no
law last longer than the meeting of the next Congress?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The contest between the two men had begun in the summer
and had been followed with keen interest in political circles.
Early in November the candidates opened headquarters
in Washington and soon the town was full of “Randall
men” and “Carlisle men,” each ready to prove his candidate a
sure winner! All of the big newspapers had correspondents
on hand, foretelling confidently the success of the candidate
favored by their readers. But there was little to indicate the
result. It all depended, it was seen, upon how deep and how
general a belief there was in the Democratic party that high
tariffs were dangerous.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only really significant feature of the fall contest in
Washington was the activity of the protected interests in
Randall’s behalf. The iron men and steel men, the wool men,
the New Jersey potters, the Standard Oil Company, the
Pennsylvania Railroad, were all said to be on hand. There
were many hints of the use of money. Mr. Barnum of
Connecticut, former United States Senator and now chairman
of the National Democratic Committee, was said to be in
town “buying mules” for Randall, as the slang of the day
went. How much truth there was in the charges of
bribery the writer does not know; but this is certain, an
alliance of business interests in support of Mr. Randall was
plainly evident in the fall of 1883. The protectionists were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>most active, but they had with them the railroads and the
Standard Oil crowd, who at that moment were fighting hard
to prevent threatened regulation of interstate commerce;
that is, all of the interests which were thriving on special
privileges were combined into a league for the continuation
of those privileges.</p>

<p class='c007'>Up to this time these allied interests had supported the
Republican party. It was in power and it had granted the
privileges they enjoyed, but they were quite willing to support
a man of any political faith who agreed with them. Naturally
their great desire was that both parties should agree to protection
as the American system, that the question should
practically be taken out of politics. This would result if
Mr. Randall’s effort to protectionize the Democrats succeeded.
Naturally, then, they were eager to do their utmost to support
him in his contest with Mr. Carlisle. But to their surprise
and unquestionably to the surprise of Mr. Randall, Mr.
Carlisle was elected speaker by a large majority. The tariff
question was to be opened again. The man whom Mr.
Carlisle selected to open it was William R. Morrison of
Illinois, who had worked shoulder to shoulder with him the
winter before in obstructing the Kelley Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Morrison was an experienced man at tariff reform;
indeed, the first Democratic tariff bill presented after the war
originated with him. That was in 1875 and 1876, when the
Democrats first obtained possession of the House. The
speaker, Michael C. Kerr, had asked Colonel Morrison to take
the chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr.
Morrison had brought in a good and reasonable measure,
one nearer in accord with sound tariff principles than those
which he presented later, but even then the Randall
faction of Protectionist-Democrats were too strong for him,
and his bill had been speedily dropped. A little later
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>Mr. Randall had succeeded Kerr as speaker and he had
dropped Morrison from the Committee. He was not
restored until 1879. But Mr. Morrison was too aggressively
honest and outspoken ever to keep silence on a
question which interested him. He had fought for reform
in Congress, in caucus, in national conventions, everywhere he
could get a hearing, and now that he had a chance to make a bill
he went at it with great zest, and in March he had it ready—“a
bill to reduce import duties and war-tariff taxes”—he
called it. The bill was clever, for it really asked nothing more
than what the Republicans themselves were already committed
to. Thus he proposed a general 20 per cent reduction. The
Republican Tariff Commission had advised from 20 to 25 per
cent in 1882—Congress in 1883 had granted only a little
over 4 per cent. So, declared Mr. Morrison, I am only
asking what your own experts have advised. This 20 per
cent reduction was to be applied horizontally to all duties
on manufactured articles. Here again Mr. Morrison was
following Republican precedent: their reduction in 1872
being a 10 per cent horizontal, and their increase in 1875
a restoration of the same. In order to forestall the objection
that this reduction might bring certain duties back to
the detested rates of 1857, Mr. Morrison put in the proviso
that no duty should be lower than that provided by the
Morrill tariff of 1861. That is, he was willing to give the
Republicans the protection they themselves had devised
before the war and which they had increased with a distinct
understanding that as soon as the war was over the old
rates should be restored. Even in putting salt and coal
on the free list, Mr. Morrison followed a not very old
Republican precedent, Mr. Hale backed by Mr. Blaine
having introduced bills to that effect into the House
in 1871.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>From the day of the introduction of Mr. Morrison’s bill
into the House, it was certain that Mr. Randall would oppose
it. Randall indeed was working day and night to rally
a strong Democratic opposition. His success was apparent
when, after three weeks of general debate, Mr. Converse,
an Ohio Democrat, suddenly moved that the enacting clause
of the bill be struck out and the motion was carried by a vote
of 159 to 155. That is, in a House having a majority of
80 Democrats a bill which was a moderate expression of a
policy to which the party had always been committed could
not be passed. Forty-one Democrats voted against the bill;
twelve of them from Pennsylvania, ten from Ohio, six from
New York, four from California, three from New Jersey,
and four from the South. It was a powerful vote, for when
boiled down it represented iron and steel, wool and sugar,
and the hold they had on the Democrats.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defeat of the Morrison Bill only aggravated the feeling
between the two factions and made it certain that there would
be a great fight over the tariff plank of the platform in Chicago
in July, when the National Convention met to nominate a
presidential candidate, and there was—one of the most
stubborn and prolonged in the history of conventions. Henry
Watterson was first on the ground with the plank “tariff-for-revenue only,”
which he had placed in the platforms of 1876
and of 1880, and which he was determined should go in again.
Ben Butler, a candidate for the presidency, followed him with
a compromise plank, and after him came Abram S. Hewitt
and Manton Marble, also with compromise expressions.
Mr. Randall’s friends talked free whiskey and free tobacco
for the plank. When the Committee on Resolutions finally
was formed it included all these gentlemen. The session
began with a deadlock over the chairman—18 being for
Morrison, 18 for Converse of Ohio, Randall’s man. From
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>that time until the end nothing but rumors of dead-locks came
behind the closed door. The sub-committee to which the framing
of the tariff plank was finally confided sat for <i>fifty-one</i> consecutive
hours, and the session ended in what the disgusted
Mr. Watterson called a “straddle,”—a plank calling for
revision in “a spirit of fairness to all interests”—one which
would “injure no domestic industry and would not deprive
American labor of the ability to compete successfully with
foreign labor.” It was an expression carefully arranged to
back all shades of opinion between Mr. Carlisle and Mr. Randall—a
platform which gave standing room to both factions,
and it really compared very well with the Republican pledge to
“correct the irregularities of the tariff and to reduce the surplus—so
as to relieve the taxpayers without injuring the
laborers or the great productive interests of the country.”
If anybody was ahead in the platform contest it was Mr.
Carlisle, and this from the fact that Mr. Morrison was selected
to present the report to the Convention.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the time of the National Convention it looked as if the
tariff would be the chief issue of the campaign, but as it
turned out the Republican candidate, Mr. Blaine, was the
issue, and he had not the vitality for the strain. His opponent,
Grover Cleveland—a man unheard of in public
affairs until three years before, but whose short record as
mayor of the city of Buffalo and governor of the State of New
York had been of such courage and patriotism that it had
made him available for the nomination to the presidency,
was elected in November by an electoral vote of 219 to 182.
The tariff issue was in Mr. Cleveland’s hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been frequently said that when Grover Cleveland
became the President of the United States he knew nothing of
the tariff. At least one tariff expert of that day has recorded
a very different opinion. In an interesting unpublished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>manuscript of reminiscences by the late Professor Perry
of Williams College there is an account of a talk the professor
had with Mr. Cleveland in the fall of 1883 in Albany. Professor
Perry had gone to Albany at the request of Thomas G.
Shearman, of Brooklyn, to speak in behalf of free trade at
a public meeting the Democratic leaders had organized, and
the afternoon before the lecture he had been taken to the
Capitol to meet the governor. “He and I stood in the corridor
for half an hour talking on the subject which had brought me
to Albany,” Professor Perry writes. “The governor, as
was proper, did most of the talking, and his interlocutor was
surprised and gratified at the clearness and strength of his
views on the whole tariff question and began to think he had
this time brought coals to New Castle, since the first official
in the state apparently knew as much about tariffs as he did,
and could express himself even better. The governor said
he was glad I came to Albany, thought he had better not
attend the meeting himself, but hoped everybody else would
go, and on parting gave me his best wishes for the efforts
made and making in behalf of the good cause, with which
efforts he seemed to be familiar. He impressed me as few
other men ever did on first acquaintance, as a strong man,
a frank man, and a man every way to be trusted.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But in any case Mr. Cleveland was too wise a man to take
radical action on a subject at the outset of a first presidential
term, particularly when that subject was sharply dividing
his followers. The election had by no means healed
the breach between the Carlisle and Randall factions. If
anything, indeed, it was widened, for Randall had by a clever
manœuvre apparently strengthened his side from the South.
He had done this by campaigning in aid of Southern Democratic
candidates for Congress who favored protection. Together
with his first lieutenant, William McAdoo of New Jersey,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Randall went in the fall of ’84 to Louisville, Kentucky, and
spoke under the very nose of his enemy, Watterson. From
Kentucky he continued his work into Tennessee and Alabama.
He did not meet with a cold reception. Everywhere he had
large audiences and proofs of sympathy, everywhere he found
newspapers to support him. To those on the inside it was
apparent that Pennsylvania had been busy in the Southern
manufacturing centres, and that its money and influence
accounted largely for the candidates and the interest. But
it was not a sign to be lightly regarded, and Mr. Randall took
care that its full strength be known to Mr. Cleveland.</p>

<p class='c007'>But however cautious Mr. Cleveland meant to be, his first
message showed that he stood with Mr. Carlisle and not with
Mr. Randall. He was for revision at once. “The fact that
our revenues are in excess of the actual needs of an economical
administration of the government justifies a reduction in the
amount exacted from the people for its support,” he wrote.
“The proposition with which we have to deal is the reduction
of the revenue received by the government and indirectly
paid by the people from the customs duties. The amount of
such reduction having been determined, the inquiry follows,
where can it best be remitted and what articles can best
be released from duty in the interests of our citizens? I
think the reduction should be made in the revenue derived
from a tax upon the imported necessaries of life.” “The
question of free trade,” Mr. Cleveland said, “is not involved,
nor is there any occasion for the general discussion of the
wisdom or experience of a protective system.” He also interpolated
a paragraph assuring the protected industries and
their working-men that there was no intention in his mind
of any ruthless changes which would hurt their interests.</p>

<p class='c007'>As was to be expected, Mr. Carlisle and Mr. Morrison
returned to the charge as soon as Congress opened. Four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>months were spent in preparing a new bill and on it the very
best brains of the party were engaged. Abram Hewitt,
who had in the previous session presented a bill embodying
his ideas, now went to work with Morrison. David Wells
and J. S. Moore, the “Parsee Merchant,” came to Washington
to give their help. The greatest care was taken to meet
the just objections to the previous measure, and when the
bill was reported in April, 1886, it was found to be more moderate
than its predecessor. The objectionable horizontal levelling
had been given up. Duties had been studied in relation to
labor cost. The free list was larger, including coal, salt, and
iron, copper and lead ores. It was a bill for which both Republicans
and Democrats might have voted without violating
party platforms, but there was no hope for it. The Randall
faction again joined the Republicans when Mr. Morrison
asked the House to go into a Committee of the Whole to consider
his bill, and voted him down by a vote of 157 to 140.
Four Republicans voted with Morrison, 35 Democrats against
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Morrison might be defeated, but tariff revision
could not be. Indeed, the situation was becoming
more complicated every day. For four years a serious business
depression had harassed the country. Mr. Carroll D.
Wright, who, as commissioner of labor, investigated the
condition and reported a little later, found that in the year
ending July, 1885, there had been fully 1,000,000 persons out
of employment. He estimated that year of idleness meant
a loss of $300,000,000 to the country. Strikes were incessant,
and in 1884 and 1885 over 20,000 failures had occurred, many
of them being in highly protected industries. Indeed, some
of the chief advocates of the system had gone down in the
general distress, among them John Roach, whose panegyric
on protection as the source of prosperity was one of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>choice pieces collected by the Tariff Commission of 1882, and
Henry Oliver, the representative on the Commission of the
iron and steel industries. The piling up of the surplus, too,
was causing more and more uneasiness. In the year ending
just after Mr. Morrison’s second bill was denied consideration,
the surplus was found to be nearly ninety-four million dollars,
with no profitable provision for spending. Even Mr. Randall
was willing to admit that this was serious, and to remedy it he
now prepared a bill. The gist of it was the reduction of the
surplus by <i>increasing</i> the duties; that is, making them prohibitory.
If nothing was imported, nothing would be collected.
Of course, there was no hope for Mr. Randall’s
proposition, though the Ways and Means Committee gave
prominence to it by an adverse report and it was discussed
fully in the public press, particularly in the New York <cite>Times</cite>,
where the “Parsee Merchant” dissected it mercilessly.</p>

<p class='c007'>This, in substance, was the condition of things when it
came time for Mr. Cleveland to send in his second message.
His first year in office had certainly given him large opportunity
to study the tariff question. It had not been
wasted. His notions had evidently been enlarged and intensified
and in his message he urged at length upon Congress the
“pressing importance” of revision. He made a strong argument
against the system which had produced the surplus he
was laboring with and at the same time caused “abnormal
and exceptional business profits,” “without corresponding
benefit to the people at large,” and it ended with a plain
warning to Congress that nothing could be accomplished
“unless the subject was approached in a patriotic spirit
of devotion to the interests of the entire country and
with a willingness to yield something to the public good.”
This message is particularly interesting in comparison
with the famous one of a year later. Indeed, it contains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>nearly all the points elaborated there. But it fell
on deaf ears. Mr. Morrison proved this when, a few days
later, he tried again to get his second bill reported, and was
defeated. Not only did Congress refuse to consider Mr.
Morrison’s bill, it adjourned in March, 1887, without any
action of any kind in regard to revenue.</p>

<p class='c007'>And while the members of Congress sullenly refused to consider
the needs of the country lest in so doing they might
sacrifice party advantage, Mr. Cleveland and his cabinet
were spending anxious days trying to find means to unclog the
treasury and avert panic. In the first six months after the
message of December, 1886, nearly $80,000,000 were applied
to taking up 3 per cent bonds. Financial uneasiness continuing,
some eighteen to nineteen millions more were spent
on the same bonds, and twenty-seven and one-half millions
in taking up bonds not yet due and in anticipating interest.
Even after this Mr. Cleveland and Mr. Fairchild, his Secretary
of the Treasury, did not feel at all certain that trouble would
not return, and as the hot weather came on and the cabinet
members prepared to leave for their summer homes, the President
arranged that they keep him informed of all their movements.
He wanted to be able to reach them, he told them,
for he had made up his mind that if there was a recurrence of
trouble he would call an extra session of Congress and lay
matters before the members in such a way that they would be
forced to act.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the summer passed and business grew better rather
than worse. In September Mr. Cleveland went to Philadelphia
to the centenary of the Constitution and there he met
Mr. Fairchild. The two talked matters over and agreed
that no extra session would be needed. “I was almost sorry,”
Mr. Cleveland once told the writer “—not sorry that the
trouble was over, but that my opportunity was lost.” But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>the <i>cause</i> of the trouble remained and continued to worry the
President. It continued, too, to worry the country. Ugly
evidences of this were continually coming from press and
people. Mr. Cleveland was accused of not realizing the situation,
of fearing the Randall faction of his party, of doing
nothing because he was playing for a second term,—the old-time
charges against the man who in a difficult situation with
a divided party behind him, studies his case and waits for a
favorable moment to act. Later in September, something
happened which set everybody agog. Secretary Fairchild
and Speaker Carlisle were reported to be at Oak View in
consultation with the President and Mr. Randall was not
present. It was taken as a sign that the President had concluded
to ignore the Randall faction. But Mr. Cleveland did
nothing more at the September council than to get the opinion
of his colleagues on the situation; he did not reveal his plan of
campaign, though at that moment he had it in mind, indeed
had practically decided upon it, and a bold, original plan it
was.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Cleveland had come to the conclusion that the country
must be forced to think about the tariff and its relation
to the business disorders, and that the only way open
to him to force this attention was to devote his entire
forthcoming message to Congress to that subject. No such
thing had ever been done by a President of the United States.
But there was no constitutional objection to the idea. Nothing
but precedent was against it and Mr. Cleveland concluded
that here was a case where the breaking of a precedent
was more useful than the observance. For weeks he turned
the matter over in his mind, taking nobody into his confidence,
until finally early in November he told his cabinet what he
had determined upon. He regretted, he said, not to use their
several reports as was the custom, particularly when everybody
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>had made so good a showing, but in his judgment the
situation justified the action. There was not an objector to
the suggestion; on the contrary, there was hearty and unanimous
approval. Every member of the cabinet seems to have
realized that the President had hit on a move of undoubted
wisdom.</p>

<p class='c007'>The writing of the message was a serious task for Mr. Cleveland.
He realized that its effect depended upon the completeness
of his argument and his making himself clear and convincing
to plain people. It was really a literary task, and Mr.
Cleveland was not a literary man. He was a lawyer, accustomed
to presenting what he had to say in the forcible and
exact but more or less technical and ponderous terms of the
law. He had a taste, too, for sonorous and unusual words
and phrases, but now he wanted to be simple,—as simple as
he could be, and still be dignified. For weeks he kept his
message within reach in the drawer of his White House
work-table, whenever he had a moment, taking it out to add
to and to correct. Finally he had the structure worked out
to his satisfaction. He would begin at the end of the story
with what the high tariff had done, the dangers and hardships
it had brought on the country, and he would tell Congress
plainly, this is your work and you alone can remedy it.
With dignity and clearness he worked out the situation:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are confronted at the threshold of your legislative
duties,” he wrote Congress, “with a condition of the national
finances which imperatively demands immediate and careful
consideration. The amount of money annually exacted
through the operation of present laws, from the industries and
necessities of the people, largely exceeds the sum necessary to
meet the expenses of the Government.... This condition
of our Treasury is not altogether new; and it has more than
once of late been submitted to the people’s representatives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>in the Congress, who alone can apply a remedy. And yet
the situation still continues with aggravated incidents, more
than ever presaging financial convulsion and widespread disaster.... If
disaster results from the continued inaction
of Congress, the responsibility must rest where it belongs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He set down the income, the expenses, the unusual efforts
made to dispose of the surplus, and after all was done, he told
them another June would probably see $140,000,000 more in
the Treasury than was needed, “with no clear and undoubted
executive power of relief.” All of the suggestions before him
for getting rid of the surplus: that is, purchasing at a premium
bonds not yet due; refunding the public debt; depositing
the money in banks throughout the country for use, he
believed to be unwise and extravagant. What was needed
was something deeper than expedients for spending money,
it was stopping the inflow by removing the cause. What
was the cause? Why, unnecessary taxation, of course.
“Our scheme of taxation by means of which this needless
surplus is taken from the people and put into the public treasury,”
Mr. Cleveland wrote, “consists of a tariff or duty levied
upon importations from abroad, and internal-revenue taxes
levied upon the consumption of tobacco and spirituous and
malt liquors. It must be conceded that none of the things
subjected to internal-revenue taxation are, strictly speaking,
necessaries. There appears to be no just complaint of this
taxation by the consumers of these articles, and there seems
to be nothing so well able to bear the burden without hardship
to any portion of the people. But our present tariff
laws, the vicious, inequitable, and illogical source of unnecessary
taxation ought to be at once revised and amended.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And Mr. Cleveland set out to explain clearly to the people
why, in his opinion, the adjectives he applied to the tariff were
not too strong. The argument is important. It was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>reason of an honest and candid man for the faith within him
and it was destined to convince masses of people and to be
the accepted argument of a majority of his party in years of
future struggling on the question. The gist of it was that the
tariff is really a tax,—that is, the price of the imported article
one buys is higher by the amount of the duty, and this duty
makes it possible for people who are manufacturers of the
same kind of articles as those imported to sell them for a price
approximately equal to that demanded for the imported
goods. In the first case the tax or duty goes to the government,
in the other case to the domestic manufacturer. “It
is said that the increase in the price of domestic manufactures
resulting from the present tariff is necessary in order that
higher wages may be paid to our working-men employed in
manufactories, than are paid for what is called the pauper
labor of Europe.” Now out of a population of 50,155,783,
2,623,089 persons are employed in such manufacturing industries
as are claimed to be benefited by a high tariff. “To
these the appeal is made to save their employment and maintain
their wages by resisting a change.... Yet with slight
reflection they will not overlook the fact that they are consumers
with the rest.... Nor can the worker in manufactures
fail to understand that while a high tariff is claimed
to be necessary to allow the payment of remunerative wages
it certainly results in a very large increase in the price of
nearly all sorts of manufactures, which in almost countless
forms he needs for the use of himself and his family. He
receives at the desk of his employer his wages, and perhaps
before he reaches his home is obliged, in a purchase for family
use of an article which embraces his own labor, to return in
the payment of the increase in price which the tariff permits,
the hard-earned compensation of many days of toil.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Cleveland felt strongly that it was to the 7,670,493
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>farmers in the country that the tariff worked particular injustice.
Seeking an illustration of his idea he went back to his
boyhood in New York State, when every farmer he knew had a
few sheep; when he himself wore a suit of homespun wool—the
very odor of which he said he remembered! What good
were these farmers getting from the wool tariff?</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think it may be fairly assumed,” he wrote, “that a large
proportion of the sheep owned by the farmers throughout the
country are found in small flocks numbering from twenty-five to
fifty. The duty on the grade of imported wool which these sheep
yield is ten cents each pound if of the value of thirty cents or less,
and twelve cents if of the value of more than thirty cents. If the
liberal estimate of six pounds be allowed for each fleece, the duty
thereon would be sixty or seventy-two cents, and this may be
taken as the utmost enhancement of its price to the farmer by
reason of this duty. Eighteen dollars would thus represent the increased
price of the wool from twenty-five sheep, and thirty-six
dollars that from the wool of fifty sheep; and at present values this
addition would amount to about one-third of its price. If upon its
sale the farmer receives this or a less tariff profit, the wool leaves
his hands charged with precisely that sum, which in all its changes
will adhere to it, until it reaches the consumer. When manufactured
into cloth and other goods and material for use, its cost is
not only increased to the extent of the farmer’s tariff profit, but
a further sum has been added for the benefit of the manufacturer
under the operation of other tariff laws. In the meantime the day
arrives when the farmer finds it necessary to purchase woollen goods
and material to clothe himself and family for the winter. When he
faces the tradesman for that purpose he discovers that he is obliged
not only to return, in the way of increased prices, his tariff profit
on the wool he sold, and which then perhaps lies before him in
manufactured form, but that he must add a considerable sum
thereto to meet a further increase in cost caused by a tariff duty on
the manufacture. Thus in the end he is roused to the fact that he
has paid upon a moderate purchase, as a result of the tariff scheme
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>which when he sold his wool seemed so profitable, an increase in
price more than sufficient to sweep away all the tariff profit he
received upon the wool he produced and sold.</p>

<p class='c014'>“When the number of farmers engaged in wool-raising is compared
with all the farmers in the country, and the small proportion
they bear to our population is considered; when it is made apparent
that, in the case of a large part of those who own sheep, the
benefit of the present tariff on wool is illusory; and, above all,
when it must be conceded that the increase of the cost of living
caused by such tariff becomes a burden upon those with moderate
means and the poor, the employed and unemployed, the sick and
well, and the young and old, and that it constitutes a tax which,
with relentless grasp, is fastened upon the clothing of every man,
woman, and child in the land, reasons are suggested why the
removal or reduction of this duty should be included in a revision
of our tariff laws.”</p>

<p class='c006'>One of the most significant parts of Mr. Cleveland’s message
from the point of view of present-day developments is that
in which he pointed out the relation of the tariff to the trusts.
By this time (1887) the movement to prevent any lowering
of domestic prices of the protected articles by natural-competition
was already strong and alarming. The sugar trust,
the National Lead Trust Company, the National Linseed Oil
Trust, the Copper Syndicate, the association of steel men, the
combinations in wax, rubber goods, oil cloth, and dozens of
other highly protected articles, were worrying the whole
country. “It is notorious,” Mr. Cleveland wrote, “that
competition is too often strangled by combinations quite
prevalent at this time, and frequently called trusts, which
have for their object the regulation of the supply and price of
commodities made and sold by members of the combination.
The people can hardly hope for any consideration in the
operation of these selfish schemes.... <i>The necessity of combination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>to maintain the price of any commodity to the tariff
point, furnishes proof that some one is willing to accept lower
prices for such commodity, and that such prices are remunerative.</i>”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Cleveland did not neglect either to touch upon another
feature of the protective trust which was causing uneasiness
and of which he was soon to learn much more than he knew
then, that was, the measures being taken to prevent any
revision at all. “So stubbornly have all efforts to reform the
present condition been resisted by those of our fellow-citizens
thus engaged (in protected industries) that they can hardly
complain of the suspicion entertained to a certain extent that
there exists an organized combination all along the line to
maintain their advantage.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Little by little with care and pains the message was beaten
out. The greatest caution was taken to have it exact. For
example, after the illustration on the farmer and his wool
was written, Mr. Cleveland became concerned for his figures.
He knew twenty-five to fifty was the right average for a
farmer’s sheep in New York State, but how about Ohio?
He called in a member of the bureau of statistics, and was
told the average Ohio flock was between twenty and forty.
And as he verified figures he qualified statements, reiterating
his assurance that no revision which would destroy any business
was contemplated—none which would throw labor out
of work or lower its wages, that no doctrinal discussion
was sought. “<i>It is a condition which confronts us—not a
theory</i>,” was his famous phrase. And most solemnly did
he beg Congress to approach the question “in a spirit
higher than partisanship, to consider it in the light of
that regard for patriotic duty which should characterize
the action of those intrusted with the weal of a confiding
people.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>Throughout the whole period of composition of the message
Mr. Cleveland took no one into his confidence. Finally, one
day after it was complete, Mr. Carlisle called on some business.
When he had finished Mr. Cleveland said: “Carlisle, I
want to read you something.” It was his message. He had
decided to present it practically as it was, he said, but he was
afraid he had made it too simple. He wanted it perfectly
dignified. Would Mr. Carlisle listen to it and make any
suggestions he might have? Walking up and down, Mr.
Carlisle listened attentively. Once or twice he broke in,
correcting what he believed to be a too general statement.
Thus Mr. Cleveland had written, “The majority of our citizens
who buy domestic articles of the same class (as imported
articles) pay a sum <i>equal</i> to the duty to the home manufacturer.”
Mr. Carlisle did not think they paid the full
amount of the duty. He believed usually it was a little less.
Mr. Cleveland had better say “substantially equal.” Mr.
Cleveland wrote finally, “at least approximately equal.”
Beyond a few suggestions of this kind Mr. Carlisle had nothing
but hearty approval for the message.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 6th of December it went to Congress. The effect
was instantaneous. All over the country thinking people
cried out that not since the Emancipation Proclamation had
a President of the United States shown equal courage and
wisdom. The patience with which Mr. Cleveland had
waited for Congress to take the action needed and to which he
had in both his previous messages urged it, the deliberation
and caution with which he had worked out <i>his</i> duty when
Congress failed to do <i>its</i> duty; the courage with which he
acted when he felt the time had come for his interference,
the high patriotism with which he had swept away all thought
of the result to himself and the party for what he believed
to be the general good—all these features appealed to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>thoughtful and led many to draw a parallel between Abraham
Lincoln in 1862 and Grover Cleveland in 1887.</p>

<p class='c007'>The immediate important political result of the message
was that it crystallized tariff sentiment in both parties. The
Democrats who had been trying to mix enough protection
with their “ultimate free-trade” or “tariff-for-revenue only”
principles to ease the fears of protected industries, and win
over Mr. Randall, turned exclusive attention to revision
without compromise. As for Mr. Randall, it was plain his
day was over—if his fight was not.</p>

<p class='c007'>At first the message caused something like a panic among
Republicans. The <cite>Tribune</cite> appealed to Mr. Blaine for help
and he sent from Paris a famous interview. If anything was
needed to emphasize the worth of Mr. Cleveland’s message, it
was supplied by Mr. Blaine’s interview. The combination of
the two documents caused something like a split in Republican
ranks. The Chicago <cite>Tribune</cite> and a number of other Western
papers came out with as strong a commendation of Mr. Cleveland
as the New York <cite>Nation</cite>, and in Minnesota, Nebraska,
and Iowa particularly, many leading Republicans publicly
approved it. Nevertheless, the final effect on the party was
to solidify the varying degrees of protectionists into one body.
Cost what it might the Democrats must not be allowed to
reform the tariff. Nothing was better campaign capital for
Republicans than the charge of “free-trade.” If Mr. Cleveland’s
will prevailed, the value of the epithet might be materially
lessened. Protection must be preserved. If its operations
were to be corrected, this must be done by its friends, not its
enemies. Whatever their differences about the degree and
extent of duties, all good Republicans must now stand together.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <span class='large'>THE MILLS AND ALLISON BILLS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is one of the ironies of the political history of this period
that the Democrat who for many years had been among the
most devoted to a reform bill, William R. Morrison of Illinois,
should not have been in Congress now that the tide had turned
to lead in its making. Mr. Morrison had been defeated in
the fall of 1886 and it was necessary to have a new chairman
for the Ways and Means Committee. Roger Q. Mills of
Texas was chosen. The appointment was a red rag to the
high protectionists, for Mr. Mills was an out-and-out free-trader.
After Mr. Carlisle he was the ablest and best informed
man in Congress on the tariff. There are two classes of
Congressmen, those who study their subjects and those
who do not. While three-fourths of Mr. Mills’s colleagues
visited with constituents, dined with their fellows, looked
after their fences, held their ears to the ground, he was poring
over tables and reports. He had entered Congress in 1873,
an ex-confederate officer thrice wounded during the war but
still as handsome a man as there was in the body—one
of the few Congressmen who never allowed Ben. Perley Poore
to put his biography into the Congressional Directory! Mr.
Mills was the soul of chivalry, and more than once exasperated
his Democratic colleague by his generosity to his
opponents. He had refused in 1883 to join the Democrats
in their opposition to the admission of the colored members
from South Carolina. They had been elected, they must be
admitted. In 1884 McKinley’s seat was contested. Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Mills became convinced that McKinley had really been elected
and he voted accordingly. Poor “Pig Iron” Kelley, ill and
distracted over the attack on his favorite doctrine of protection
as well as over the corruption in his own party which
had at last become too general and high-colored to escape
even his blind eyes, had angered the House and it had moved
to reprimand him. Mr. Mills protested: he was old, he
had faithfully served his country, he would have no part in
so cruel and unjust a measure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Mills had been brought up in the fine old school of
Democracy. Free speech, free trade, independent action,
self-reliance were cardinal virtues to him. He took his principles
as he found them in Thomas Jefferson, and he literally
followed Jefferson’s advice to go back frequently to the
ideas on which the government had been founded for encouragement
and advice. The interpretation of protection
which he had found in force when he entered Congress and
the growing combinations of business men to support it, he
despised, and from the first all his fighting blood had been up
against them. He had been on the Ways and Means Committee
continually since his first appointment and had contributed
some of the strongest arguments and sayings to be found
in the various debates. “Free poker and a taxed Gospel”
was his phrase; his way of characterizing the failure to get
Bibles on the free list and playing cards off.</p>

<p class='c007'>Naturally Mr. Mills brought to his chairmanship some
positive ideas. One of the most positive was that there should
be no hearings given to manufacturers. If he had denied the
right to life, liberty, and happiness, no louder wail would have
arisen. With every tariff bill the “hearings” had been growing
longer and more futile, declared Mr. Mills, and one who
undertakes to read them, even to look over them, cannot
deny that he was right. Admitting all that any candid protectionists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>could claim for the value of the hearings there
was already an accumulation of recent ones as great as any
committee could digest. There were the two big volumes
of the tariff commission dated 1883, perhaps on the whole the
best which had been taken; there were several volumes from
Mr. Morrison’s committee and from the Senate Finance
Committee. This was enough in Mr. Mills’s opinion and he
set his foot down about taking further testimony of this
kind. He even held out against meeting socially the gentlemen
who haunted Washington for the purpose of keeping
their representatives in mind of what might happen “back
home” if what they had asked was not given. Several
amusing incidents resulted from his obstinate stand on the
matter. One came through the determination of the “Parsee
Merchant” to force Mr. Mills to talk with some of the
manufacturers. The “Parsee” was as devoted a free-trader
as Mr. Mills, but he did not share Mr. Mills’s antipathy to
lobbyists. He was a man of the world, a great diner-out, a
brilliant talker. At his own dinners in Washington he brought
together people of the most varied tastes. One night he
entertained the Ways and Means Committee, including the
Chairman. The dinner was under way when a card was
brought in. With assumed surprise Mr. Moore exclaimed,
“Why, it’s my friend Mr. Havemeyer, bring him in.” Now
for some time Mr. Mills had been besought to meet Mr.
Havemeyer, and he had persistently refused. He did not propose
to be trapped into a meeting. The great sugar man came
in one door; Mr. Mills went out the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Mills had of course decided notions about the principles
to be embodied in the bill. He stood for free raw materials,
and consequently increased the free list considerably; wool,
salt, lumber, wood pulp, flax, hemp, and jute were the important
additions. Tin plates and cotton-ties were the leading
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>manufactured items he made free. His chief hobby, however,
was no specific duties. As the schedules then stood both
specific and ad valorem were assessed on a great variety of
articles. As an illustration, take dress goods, which started
with a division into part wool and all wool. The former class
was then divided according to value, those goods worth 20
cents or less per square yard carrying a specific duty of 5
cents per square yard and 35 cents ad valorem; those worth
more than 20 cents, 7 cents and 40 per cent ad valorem. All-wool
goods were divided according to weight: those weighing
4 ounces or less per square yard carried 9 cents per square yard,
and 40 per cent ad valorem; those over 4 ounces, 35 cents
per pound and 40 per cent ad valorem. The confusion resulting
from this complexity was constant and opportunity for
fraud increased with each variation. The scandals through the
’70’s and ’80’s charged by the Republicans solely to ad valorem
duties were largely due to the irritating classifications according
to value and the mixture of ad valorem and specific
duties.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Mr. Mills went to work on the bill he had before him
a trial measure on which he had spent six months at home before
his appointment and which for his own satisfaction he
had had printed. He had attempted in his bill to avoid all
specific duties; thus in the case of dress goods he wiped out all
classifications and put a straight 40 per cent on the value, but
as he afterwards said: “When I got to work with my brethren
on the bill I found it would not go and I had to abandon my
ad valorem tariff bill. The schoolmaster had not been sufficiently
around to bring our people back to the Democratic principle
of taxation as to value.” Mr. Mills simplified the complicated
cotton schedule in the same way that he had
the woollen schedule, by sweeping away the confusing
classifications and assessing a straight 40 per cent on their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>value. The duties were reduced less drastically on iron and
steel, and sugar suffered a reduction of only 18 per cent. The
failure to apply the same rule to iron and steel and sugar as
to wool and cotton was probably “geographic,” as Tom Reed
charged. “This bill, far from being philosophical, is political
from one end to the other,” Mr. Reed said in debate. “Is
it not singular that this great principle of labor cost somehow
or other seems to be strictly geographical—that it strikes
the Canadian line with cyclonic force and that the Southern
states seem to be so far removed from the storm centre as
not to be in the slightest degree even ruffled?” Mr. Mills’s
committee was made up largely of Southerners; iron and
sugar interests were strong in their districts, both claimed
special protection and both received it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Mills Bill aroused a tremendous discussion. The
“Great Debate,” as it is called in tariff annals, lasted for over
a month. One hundred and fifty-one speeches were made,
those of Mr. Mills, McMillin of Tennessee, Wilson of West
Virginia, Scott of Pennsylvania, Cox of New York, and Carlisle
of Kentucky were the most important on the Democratic side:
those of Reed of Maine, McKinley of Ohio, Burrows of
Michigan, Butterworth of Ohio, and Kelley of Pennsylvania,
the leading ones on the Republican side. The Democratic
attack was along the lines of Mr. Cleveland’s message with
particular emphasis on the small per cent of wages directly
affected by the tariff and the large amount of the duty which
went elsewhere than to labor. A large body of expert calculations
on these points were at their service. The first point
had been recently solved by three able statisticians, each
working independent of the other. They were Worthington
Ford, E. B. Elliot, and Simon Newcomb. The results
at which they arrived were bad for the claim that high wages
depended on protection. They showed that as a fact the duties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>affected but a small amount of labor; according to Mr. Ford
4.07 per cent, according to Mr. Elliot 4.34 per cent, to Mr.
Newcomb 5½. That is, there was 94 per cent of the wages
of the community which were not affected by tariffs, although
the earners of these wages were paying higher prices for
many of the necessities of life because of these tariffs.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the second point Mr. Mills and his colleague had the
completest official study of the cost of production in the
United States which had been made up to that time. This
study was in the first report ever published by the Bureau
of Labor,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c016'><sup>[1]</sup></a> and was made by our first Commissioner, Carroll
D. Wright. Mr. Wright showed conclusively how much less
a part muscular labor played in the cost of a great bulk
of protected articles than was supposed. Since the Civil War
machines had displaced men in the making of agricultural
implements, until 600 men did what formerly had required
2100; in boots and shoes 100 were doing what had formerly
required 500; in carpet making, in cotton weaving, in the
lumber business, in the production of metals, in the manufacture
of paper, of woollen goods, of tobacco, of silk, of practically
everything, indeed, a sweeping displacement of hand
labor had taken place and always with a resulting increase
of quantity and decrease of labor cost. This was in 1886, and
what was then a comparatively new development is to-day an
old story, but one far more wonderful. Machines have multiplied
and improved in practically every industry, with a
resulting decrease in labor cost.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. The Bureau was established by Congress in 1884, President Arthur approving.
Mr. Cleveland made the first appointment in January, 1885.</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Mills made an effective argument from Mr. Wright’s
report by comparing the labor cost in the manufacture of
many leading necessities of life with the duties which the
manufacturers were fighting for in the name of labor.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>“I find in this report,” said Mr. Mills, “one pair of 5–pound
blankets. The whole cost as stated by the manufacturer is $2.51.
The labor cost is 35 cents. The tariff is $1.90. Now here is
$1.55 in this tariff over and above the entire labor cost of these
blankets.... Here is one yard of flannel weighing 4 ounces;
it cost 18 cents, of which the laborer got 3 cents, the tariff on it is
8 cents. How is it that the whole 8 cents did not get into the hands
of the laborer?... One yard of cashmere, weighing 16 ounces
costs $1.38. The labor cost is 29 cents; the tariff duty is 80
cents. One pound of sewing silk costs $5.66; the cost for labor is
85 cents; the tariff is $1.69. One gallon of linseed oil costs 46
cents; the labor cost is 2 cents; the tariff cost is 25 cents.
One ton of bar iron costs $31.00. The labor cost is $10.00.
The tariff fixes several rates for bar-iron and gives the lowest
rate $17.92. One ton of foundry iron costs $11.00; the labor costs
$1.64; the tariff is $6.72. None of these tariffs go to the laborer.
The road is blocked up. They cannot pass the pocket of the manufacturers.
This “great American” system that is intended to secure
high wages for our laborers is so perverted that all its beneficence
intended for the poor workingman stops in the pockets of his employer
and the laborer only gets what he can command in the
open market for his work.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Now admitting that Mr. Mills was too sweeping in his conclusion,
there is no escaping the truth or the meaning of the
figures. The price of all sorts of necessary manufactured
articles was increased by the duties, rarely to their full amount
to be sure, but yet much beyond what was necessary to
put the domestic manufacturer on an equal footing with the
foreigner. Somebody got the extra profit, and it was not the
workingman. But the workingman paid the extra price.
Mr. Mills illustrated it in this way. “Suppose,” he said,
“that a laborer who is earning a dollar a day by his work
finds a suit of woollen clothes he can buy for $10.00 without
the tariff. Then the suit can be procured for 10 days’ work, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>the manufacturer goes to Congress and says, ‘I must be protected
against the man buying this cheap suit of clothes,’
And Congress protects him by putting on a duty of 100 per
cent, or $10.00. Now it will require the laborer to work twenty
days to get this suit of clothes. Now tell me if 10 days of
his labor have not been annihilated?”</p>

<p class='c007'>It fell to William McKinley of Ohio, who for the first time
in the Great Debate showed his skill in tariff matters, to
answer Mr. Mills. “It is an old story,” he said lightly. “It
is found in Adam Smith, but it is not true”; and to prove
it was not true Mr. McKinley awakened the House by dragging
from his desk a full suit of ready-made clothes. Holding
them up triumphantly in one hand, he showed in the other a
bill for them. They cost just $10.00. “So you see,” went on
Mr. McKinley, “the poor fellow did not have to work 10 days
more to get that suit of clothes.” There was “great applause
and laughter” on the Republican side and there was
talk of having the suit photographed to show in the campaign.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Mills said nothing, but he began an investigation.
He sent to the shop where, according to the bill read by Mr.
McKinley, and printed in the Congressional Record, the
suit had been bought, and secured one like it. He then
traced it to the manufacturer and from him secured an exact
analysis of its cost. The result pleased him and he decided
to save it for his speech closing the debate, but when the day
came Mr. Mills was so full of facts and figures that he was
forgetting the suit. His son, Mr. Charles H. Mills, was in
the gallery, and realizing the situation passed down a note
reading, “Don’t forget McKinley’s suit of clothes.” A
smile passed over the Colonel’s face and taking a fresh start
he presented the result of his investigation. The gist of his
entertaining remarks was that the suit had actually cost to
manufacture, tariff aside, just $4.98. The labor cost was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>$1.65. The tariff on the wool used in the suit was $1.70.
Adding this to the $4.98, gave $6.68 and on this sum the manufacturer
was allowed a duty of 40 per cent to compensate
for the wool tax and also of 35 per cent to protect him against
the imported article. The whole cost, plus the three tariffs
was $10.71. “Of course,” said Mr. Mills, “the manufacturer
had to undersell the foreign suit and to do so he dropped under
him 71 cents and sold his $4.98 suit for $10.00 with the help of
the tariffs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As for Mr. McKinley’s comment that the illustration came
from Adam Smith, Mr. Mills had a story to tell. It reminded
him, he said, of the small boy who was caught thieving and
whose mother in chiding him, said, “Don’t you know it is
wrong to steal? Don’t you know what the Bible says?”
“Oh, now, mother,” the youngster replied, “that’s an old
story. Moses told it 4000 years ago.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As a matter of fact, Mr. McKinley’s answer to Mr. Mills
had been a trick. Mr. Mills had not said that a man could
not buy a suit of clothes for $10.00 in the United States; he
said that if a tariff of 100 per cent was put on a suit which
could be sold for $10.00 without the tariff, a man would pay
$20.00 for his suit. Mr. McKinley had diverted attention
from the real point simply by holding up a ten-dollar suit
in the Halls of Congress. It was characteristic of the way
in which the taxation element of the tariff was beginning to
be handled that after Mr. Mills’s answer the suit disappeared
entirely from the debate; that is, there began at this time a
concerted effort on the part of supporters of protection to evade
or deny the fact that the tariff was a tax the effect of which was
to increase the cost of living. In all the early years this point
was met with fairness. The tariff was a tax consented to
by a majority of the people because of what they believed
to be good and sufficient reasons. Henry Clay called it a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>tax,—the protectionists who advocated raising the duties
in the Civil War called them taxes. The Republican party as
a whole admitted them to be taxes in 1872. The tariff Commission
of 1883, made up of protectionists, approved by a
Republican administration, called them taxes—taxes which
had become largely unnecessary for the purposes for which
they were laid and therefore unjust.</p>

<p class='c007'>All through the Great Debate the necessity of stopping
the use of the word grew on the Republicans. They sought
to replace the obnoxious term which was unquestionably
influencing the country by something alluring. The tariff a
tax, they cried; why, the tariff is the <i>cause</i> of prosperity; and
they set out to force the argument away from the practical
questions which Mr. Cleveland’s message had raised,—the
question of who, after all, got the profit, the question of the
relation of high duties to panics and trusts, to depressions
and high prices.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We have now spent twenty days in the discussion of the
Mills Bill,” said Mr. Reed, when he made his leading speech.
“Have you noticed what has been the most utterly insignificant
thing in the discussion? The most utterly insignificant
thing in the discussion has been the Mills Bill.” It was true,
and Mr. Reed’s party was responsible. It was engaged in a
shrewd struggle to divert attention from damaging evidence
and to establish a superstitious reverence for the doctrine
of protection which would put it out of the reach of attack by
facts and logic.</p>

<p class='c007'>Seven months after Mr. Cleveland’s message, July 21, the
House passed the Mills Bill—passed it by a very decent
majority—162 to 114. Mr. Randall’s followers, who in
May, 1884, had been 41 strong against Mr. Morrison’s original
bill, and in June, 1886, 35 strong against his second bill,
had dwindled to three or four. They had not given up without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>a fight. Randall had prepared a second bill to introduce,
but even the most devoted of his followers realized the hopelessness
at that moment of any bill which advocated reduction
as his did by free tobacco and free whiskey and prohibitory
tariffs. Randall, too, was away from the House much of the
spring of 1888, suffering from the disease which two years
later was to end his life; and his group, left without the stimulus
of his magnetic presence, subject to the pressure of the
majority and to the rising popular approval of Mr. Cleveland,
dwindled away one by one. They left him with heavy
hearts. Indeed, for more than one of them the most painful
experience of his political life was “going back on Sam Randall,”—not,
let it be noted, on the doctrine of protection.</p>

<p class='c007'>Four days after the House bill was passed it was turned
over to a sub-committee of the Senate Finance Committee,
appointed two months before to prepare for its reception.
The chairman of this sub-committee was Senator William
B. Allison of Iowa. It could not have been a better man.
Allison was at the time nearly sixty years old and he had been
in Congress constantly for over twenty-five years. Most of
the time he had served on the House or Senate Committees
in charge of the tariff. He had begun his career as a very
moderate protectionist of the Garfield type. In all of the
early years of the Republican struggle to keep the war-time
promises as to high duties, <i>i.e.</i> to reduce them as the internal
taxes came off, Allison had been a leader. In March
of 1870, when the Schenck Bill was under consideration, he
made one of the ablest tariff reform speeches of the period; a
speech which dogged his later life. But Allison was a strong
party man. As the tariff became gradually a matter of
politics rather than of principle he adapted his views to the
needs of the campaigns, striving diligently for duties which
would win the most supporters and do the least harm to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>consumers. By temperament he was admirably adapted to
compromise. They used to say in Iowa that he could walk
on eggs from Des Moines to Washington and not break one.
Senator Dolliver admirably characterized Senator Allison’s
gift of getting on with men in his eulogy delivered in the
Senate in 1905: “He avoided dogmatism even in its most
attractive forms and made room in the expression of his
opinion for those differences which he knew would be encountered
sooner or later, giving leeway for composing those
disagreements which he knew must be composed before anything
could be actually done.” Senator Allison was peculiarly
ready for making a tariff bill at this time, for he had
been the head of a sub-committee which only a few months
before had finished an important new measure for reforming
the Administration of the Customs. This had already
passed the Senate and at the time Allison and his colleagues
took up revision, was before the Committee of Ways and
Means.</p>

<p class='c007'>By way of emphasizing its sympathy with the protected as
well as to show its disapproval of Mr. Mills’s attitude, the
Senate Committee began hearings in May of 1888 which
were continued at intervals until the first of the next year.
They make four big volumes and altogether are an illuminating
compilation for the student. Much more important than
the hearings was a piece of work going on quietly at the same
time at Senator Allison’s request: this was the actual preparation
by an expert of a bill which was to serve as a guide
and model to the Committee. The expert chosen was Colonel
George C. Tichenor, a man who knew more about the
administration of our customs and had more authoritative
notions of what duties should be to meet a moderate protectionist
program than anybody then living. Colonel Tichenor
had first come into touch with the tariff in 1877 when he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>had been appointed by John Sherman, then Secretary of the
Treasury, a special agent of the Department. Here he was
so impressed with the importance of the question and possibly
also with the rarity of men who really knew anything about
it, that he determined to master all its intricacies. In 1881
he was sent abroad by the Secretary to study undervaluations
and the cost of production. Colonel Tichenor spent
some four years in different parts of Europe seriously examining
various sides of the tariff question. His studies had led
him to one conclusion which was of particular influence at the
moment, and that was that specific duties should replace ad
valorem wherever possible, the exact opposite to Mr. Mills’s
conclusion. Colonel Tichenor believed the ad valorem duty
more equitable, but that human ingenuity and dishonesty
would always find ways of evading it, and that as a result both
the honest importers and the government would suffer. It
was to be expected that the administration should feel strongly
about undervaluations and be ready to accept almost any
system which promised to make them more difficult. The
scandals arising from them had been flagrant for years.
These undervaluations were by no means due alone to dishonest
importers, they were due quite as much to dishonest
and incompetent customs-house officials, to bungling and
tricky schedules, and to a general belief in Europe that our
tariffs <i>ought</i> to be evaded.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many of Tichenor’s recommendations had a value which
time has emphasized, such was his warning that specific
duties could not be placed arbitrarily without grave injustice;
it would require time and preparation to arrange them;
such was his protest against “ambiguous phrases, vague
description, loose and uncertain definitions, contradictory
terms” in a tariff law, and his appeal for “plain, simple, and
definite terms.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Colonel Tichenor had been continued in the Treasury
Department after Mr. Sherman left it by President
Cleveland. He had been used indeed almost as much by
the Democrats as by the Republicans. The Randall Bill
referred to above was done largely by Tichenor and into it he
had introduced many of his favorite ideas. While he was
working on the Randall Bill, Mr. Allison had sought his help
on the Customs Administration bill; indeed, the latter was
much more Colonel Tichenor’s bill than any one else’s.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be seen then that the man to whom Senator Allison
turned in the spring of 1888 was thoroughly equipped to
make a bill—that he did not even have to begin at the
bottom. He had one in hand, the Randall Bill introduced in
March but which had never been heard from since its reference
to the Ways and Means Committee. By readjusting
the rates of this bill to meet more perfectly Senator Allison’s
ideas, Colonel Tichenor soon turned over the document on
which the sub-committee went to work. It became apparent
almost at once to those who knew what was doing in the Committee
that the rates in Colonel Tichenor’s bill were being
decidedly increased—a fact which seems to have caused
Allison some concern, for we find him writing to Tichenor in
August, “You have seen that the constant tendency here is
to increase rates. How would this suit our people in the
West?”</p>

<p class='c007'>In October (the 3d) Mr. Allison reported his bill to the
Senate as a substitute for the Mills Bill. The latter was so
bad, he said, that it could not be amended. There was nothing
to do but prepare an entirely new measure. What this measure
was, <i>not</i> Mr. Allison, but Nelson W. Aldrich of Rhode
Island, explained. This report is the first important evidence
we have of the powerful influence Mr. Aldrich had already
come to exercise in the Senate on tariff matters. It is also a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>complete statement of the interpretation of protection which
he had adopted and to which he has been ever since faithful.
Mr. Aldrich had been in the Senate since 1881. In the making
of the bill of 1883 his work for his wool, cotton, and sugar
constituents had been marked by those who studied the debates
and votes. From that time on business men interested
in tariffs had come to count on him more and more. By 1888
he had indeed become more influential than either Sherman or
Allison. The report he now made shows that he had none of
their leanings towards moderation, none of their anxieties
over the evils in protection which both had at one time or another
admitted, none of their dislike of complicated schedules
and classifications. Mr. Aldrich rejected every principle on
which Mr. Mills had worked. He was particularly hard on
the attempt to substitute ad valorem for specific duties. The
most important work Congress had in hand after taking care
of the surplus was stopping undervaluations, he declared;
nothing but specific duties would accomplish this. No expert
knowledge was required for the enforcement of specific
duties by customs officials, “as the articles upon which they
are levied have only to be counted, weighed, or measured”;
an extraordinary statement when one remembers the scandals
in those years over specific duties on sugar; extraordinary also
when one finds that many of the schedules in the new bill,
as in the law then in force, were subdivided according
to the value of the articles, and that in addition to the
specific duties on these classes were ad valorem duties.
Thus Mr. Aldrich, after denouncing ad valorem duties,
presented a bill filled with ad valorems laid on ad valorems!
Sharp issue was of course taken with Mr. Mills’s
free list. Mr. Aldrich declared it destructive. The Republicans
had indeed pretty generally given up the idea of admitting
free any raw materials which were produced in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>country. The notion that if you gave to one you must to all
had been steadily making converts since the early ’70’s, and
it was laid down emphatically now by Mr. Aldrich as one of
the tariff principles of the party. No free raw materials where
there is competition, but a long free list. Mr. Aldrich called
attention to the growth of the free list as a proof of the party’s
generosity. In 1847, he said, 88 per cent of the articles imported
were dutiable. This had been cut down in 1887 to
66 per cent. This was a deceptive statement, for in that
period the variety of things imported had enormously increased,
and besides the free list was made up largely of articles
so rare and unimportant that the ordinary person had to consult
the dictionary to know for what many of them were used.
In the nature of the case, it could matter little to consumers
whether they carried a duty or not. But increasing the free
list had become a favorite pastime with enthusiasts like
Mr. Kelley. It was presented as a proof of the interest that
the protectionist had in the consumer!</p>

<p class='c007'>The general reduction by the Mills Bill of rates on the
articles where the tariff affects the multitude, that is, on iron
and steel and woollen and cotton goods, was resented bitterly
by Mr. Aldrich. He represented the class of Republicans
that had come to feel that protection had created these industries
and professed to believe that duties low enough to
admit foreign goods in free competition with them would be
ruinous. The Senate bill raised many of the rates considerably
above what they were in the bill of ’83, and in other cases
lowered them, but still kept them at a prohibitive point.
Structural steel is a case in point. It had begun to show
the future which was before it as a building material replacing
wood, particularly in larger buildings and in
bridges. Under the bill of ’83 the duty had been 102¾
per cent. The Mills Bill made it 49.32. The Allison Bill
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>now put it up to something over 91 per cent. There was no
possible justification for so high a duty. Steel beams of
foreign manufacture could be put down in the United States
at that date at about $27.00 a ton exclusive of the tariff.
But steel beams were selling in the United States at $66.00 a
ton. The argument which raged over this particular article
was typical of the way the two parties were handling the
question. Senator Vest, in declaring the rate in the Senate
bill excessive, quoted an agreement between Mr. Carnegie
and the Knights of Labor as his authority for saying that the
cost of turning a ton of pig-iron into steel rails was $4.09, and
that steel beams cost 30 per cent more, or $5.32 a ton. In
reply to this showing, Senator Aldrich said that $4.09 was
not a fair estimate of the cost of steel rails, that it represented
only the cost of turning pig-iron into steel rails. That on
fixing the duty on rails one should go back to the mines and
take the cost of the iron as it comes from the earth and
the cost of changing it into pig-iron. To which argument
Senator Vest replied: “It seems to me, with the greatest
respect to the Senators from Iowa and Rhode Island that
the proposition is entirely absurd and without the shadow
of logical foundation. The pig-iron comes to the manufacture
of steel rails a finished product. The cost of the pig-iron had
paid all the antecedent cost of manufacture, and it would
be just as forcible an argument to say that if the tailor who
makes my coat is to be protected, we are not to take as a
basis of calculation the cost of the cloth as it came to the
tailor’s shop, but we are to go back to the wool of the sheep,
to the cost of shearing, to the cost of washing, to the cost
of carting, and all this is to be added to the cost of the cloth,
although the tailor has already paid it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The opponents of the rates on steel products were loud in
their trust alarm. They certainly had an effective example
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>to hold up. Mr. Carnegie had begun to come into his own,
as an illustration of what combined transportation and tariff
privileges can do for an able manufacturer. He and his
profits and his castle at Skibo figure in every debate on iron
and steel products at this period. Even Senator Aldrich had
grudgingly to admit a trust in steel beams, but he hopefully
declared that if the prohibitive duty was retained, domestic
competition would destroy the monopoly. Senator Sherman
was not quite so hopeful as Senator Aldrich. He was at last
beginning to feel some doubt about the infallibility of domestic
competition.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reduction of the revenue which both parties recognized
as of chief importance, the Senate bill sought to effect by the
repeal or reduction of direct taxes on whiskey, tobacco, and
alcohol used in the arts, and by reducing lower than the Mills
Bill had the duty on sugar. An important principle which
Mr. Aldrich adopted in his report was Mr. Kelley’s favorite
argument that the way to reduce was to raise rates so high that
people could not afford to import: that is, reduction by increasing
taxation. Another significant feature of the document
was the complete repudiation of the old promise to reduce
rates when the extraordinary expenses of the Civil
War had been fully met. “The practical question which
we have to solve,” said Mr. Aldrich, “is not the date when
duties were established or the circumstances or promises
under which they were levied; but, the desirability of
protection being conceded, it is what rates are proper
and adequate under existing circumstances.” Equally significant
was the almost exclusive attention Mr. Aldrich’s
report gave to the manufacturer and his laborer. To hear
him one would have gathered that the interests of the consumers
could not be served except through protection. The
almost exclusive attention given to the manufacturer by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>Senate bill was only an expression of the appeal which the
Republican party was making in the campaign for the presidency.
The platform of the party had declared, “The
protection system must be maintained”; such a revision
must be made as would “check imports of such articles
as are produced by our people, the production of which gives
employment to our labor, and releases from import duties
those articles of foreign production, except luxuries, the like
of which cannot be produced at home. If there still remains a
larger revenue than is required for the wants of the government,
we favor the entire repeal of internal taxes rather than the
surrender of any part of our protective system, at the joint
behest of the whiskey trust and the agents of foreign manufacturers.”
It was practically a declaration for prohibitive
tariff, nothing else indeed would “check imports of such
articles as are made by our people.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no doubt that the party was driven to this extreme
position on protection by its own political difficulties.
The Mugwump movement out of the party in the early
’80’s, due partly to the failure of the leaders to keep faith on
the tariff, and more to the general corruption in its service
and its methods, had cost them the election of 1884. Mr.
Cleveland had stolen their thunder as revisionists when he
put boldly to the country a doctrine very like that which
they had publicly proclaimed in 1872 and 1880. The only
element in the country they could rely upon in 1888 was the
manufacturers, and they could only rely upon them when
they gave them what they asked. Particularly necessary
was it that they produce a bill which should in principle
and practice satisfy the Iron and Steel Association. This
organization had come to take the same political relation to the
tariff that the Industrial League had held earlier. Like its
predecessor, it aspired to choose chairmen for the Ways and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>Means Committee, to name presidents, and to write tariff
bills. Its position in the Republican party in 1888, which
was close to that of a dictator, was due almost as much to
the recognition it had received from Mr. Blaine as to its
own energy and efficiency. As we have seen, Mr. Blaine in
the ’70’s had thought it good politics to serve the Industrial
League in any way he could. When the Iron and Steel
Association gradually replaced that organization he followed
the same practice and in 1884, took one of its leading
members, B. F. Jones of Pittsburg, as chairman of the Republican
National Convention. Mr. Cleveland’s election,
and the popular revolt against the high tariff attitude, had
only quickened the determination of the Iron and Steel
Association to protectionize the country, to get out of the
way all pestiferous Republican tariff reformers, all free-trade
and tariff-for-revenue only Democrats. They began on the
Congressional districts and did some most effective work.
Their most brilliant stroke was defeating William R. Morrison
of Illinois in 1886. For years Mr. Morrison had represented
his District in Congress. He had won the hostility of the Iron
and Steel Association by his aggressive fight on protection, and
it decided he must go. In the fall of 1886 John Jarrett of Pittsburg,
a former president of the Amalgamated Iron and Steel
Association and at the time president of the Tin Plate Association,
went into Mr. Morrison’s district, and by free use
of money, “$3.00 a day and all necessary expenses” according
to his own published letters, had organized a large body of
laborers to work for protection. There were some bitter
charges made against Jarrett’s methods; whatever they
were, and it seems from the evidence that they were “bribery
and hiring,” they were successful. Mr. Morrison’s majority
was changed to a substantial minority.</p>

<p class='c007'>When it came to the campaign of 1888 the Iron and Steel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>Association decided that the most critical point was the
chairman of the National Republican Committee. Jones
had made a fiasco of the campaign of 1884—no more practical
business men were wanted. The one man the Association
did want was Senator Quay of Pennsylvania. But Mr. Quay
had a record behind him that he was none too anxious to have
aired, and he did not want the work. The Iron and Steel Association,
however, had determined that he must serve, and
in July, a few days before the National Committee met, James
M. Swank, who had been secretary of the Association since
1873 and its general manager since 1885, a position he
still holds, and who for many years has managed every tariff
campaign in which his Association has been interested, took
matters into his own hands and telegraphed General
Harrison’s managers that it was Senator Quay alone who
would meet the approval of the financial interests of the East.
Without his knowledge Senator Quay was appointed. He had
not been in favor of Harrison’s nomination, had only consented
to it when he found John Sherman, his own candidate,
could not be named, and even then not until he had
assurances from Indianapolis that Pennsylvania should have
a seat in the cabinet. Nominated by the committee, he
finally accepted. The first person Mr. Quay consulted was
John Wanamaker (who afterwards received the seat in the
cabinet which Mr. Harrison had promised Pennsylvania),
who saw to the funds. As to Mr. Quay, he saw to using them
to oil and fire the remarkable campaign he set in force—a
campaign for protection backed by the protected. The
highest Republican political authorities have declared repeatedly
that only Quay could have won the campaign of
1888.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is doubtful if there has ever been a political campaign in
the United States where the appeal for money was so frank—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>acknowledgment that success depended upon it so open.
For several years the party had been relying more and more
on the use of money and had also been less and less nice about
how it used it. It was an open secret that Indiana had been
carried in 1880 by the “bright new crisp two-dollar bills” of
Stephen W. Dorsey, secretary of the National Republican
Executive Committee. The dominant faction of the party
seemed indeed to think Dorsey’s work nothing more than a
clever trick; no less a person than General Arthur, soon to be
inaugurated as Vice-President of the United States, boasting
of it at a dinner at Delmonico’s in February, 1881, said, “Indiana
was really, I suppose, a Democratic state. It had been
put down in the books always as a state that might be carried
by close and perfect organization and a great deal of ——”
General Arthur hesitated, while everybody laughed. “I see
the reporters are present,” he continued; “therefore I will
simply say that everybody showed a great deal of interest in
the occasion and distributed tracts and political documents
all through the state.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The struggle for money in 1884 had been almost pathetic.
Mr. Jones had of course the richest group in the country to
draw from—the iron and steel manufacturers, and he gave
liberally himself,—$87,000, it was reported at the time. He
did not get enough, and a few days before the election, October
29, a dinner was given in New York for the express purpose of
raising funds: a millionnaires’ dinner, at which were represented
all the various “special interests” of the day, not
tariff interests alone, but the railroads, the Standard Oil
Company, monopolies and privileges generally. Large sums
of money were pledged at this “Belshazzar’s Feast,” as the
newspapers dubbed it. Who gave, and how much, were of
course not recorded. David Wells said that he had it on the
best authority that Jay Gould and John Wanamaker each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>contributed $100,000, but what his authority was the author
does not know. Campaign contributions were not in as bad
order in 1884 as they are to-day, but there was still a certain
sense that contributions of $100,000 to campaign expenses,
made on the eve of an election, were suspicious, and there
is no doubt that the “monopoly dinner” helped defeat
Blaine.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another practice carried to the scandal point in the campaign
of ’84 was that of extracting contributions from government
officials. In Indiana a political manager informed the
Federal employees that a list of the names and amounts given
by each person would be carefully made out and the same
reported to the National Committee, and a list would also
be made of all persons who did not contribute. Quarters were
set up in Washington purposely to work the government
employees. In 1888 these proceedings were not repeated
by the Republicans, and rumor that the Democrats in
Chicago were attempting them caused a violent discussion
in Congress.</p>

<p class='c007'>The money precedent was well established then in the party
and in 1888 the managers began as early as May, before the
Convention nominated Harrison, to gather it in. The Mills
Bill, with its free list, ad valorem duties, and reduced schedules,
was still in debate, and naturally the money-getters appealed
to the protected. James P. Foster, President of the Republican
League of the United States sounded the slogan for the
campaign in a letter which stated with amazing frankness the
feeling the Republicans themselves had about who was getting
the benefit of the “bulwark of prosperity.” It was the
manufacturers, particularly the manufacturers of Pennsylvania,
who being the most highly protected, ought to be “put
over the fire and all the fat fried out of them.” Throughout
his campaign Mr. Foster kept up this cry for “fat.” Another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>organization as active in money raising as Mr. Foster’s
Republican League was the Tariff League founded in 1884 by
Robert Porter, one of the members of the Tariff Commission
of 1883. This League took itself with great seriousness and
taught the doctrine pure and undefiled without qualification
or hesitation. It divided none of the glory of prosperity
with the energy and the thrift or the natural resources of the
country. We were what we were because of protection and
protection alone. The officers of the League undoubtedly
believed in what they said, and they raised money as men
would to spread the Gospel.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was impossible that money raised from men interested
as beneficiaries of protection were, should be all used without
scandal. The one implies the other. Perhaps the most
notorious incident of misused funds occurred in General
Harrison’s own state.</p>

<p class='c007'>But quite apart from the corruption which went on, a
great debate characterized the campaign,—a debate which
followed the line of the House arguments on the Mills Bill, of
the Senate’s on the Allison Bill. The speeches in the two
Houses were indeed campaign speeches, addresses not to a
deliberating body, but to a balloting constituency. The
Democrats depended mainly on the cry of excessive taxation.
Their platform had rung the changes on the word until it
almost lost its effect from over-repetition. The Republicans
seized the opening and answered them with jeers. In New
York City they even carried parrots in their processions taught
to cry “tariff is a tax.” The high prices of certain necessities
like woollen garments due to the tariff was another effective
Democratic argument. General Harrison dismissed it lightly.
“I have an impression,” he said, “that some things may be too
cheap” “cheap coats involve cheap men.” There could have
been no better epigram for those bent on keeping up prices.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Argue as the Democrats would that the man who had to pay
$20.00 here for a suit that would cost him but $10.00 abroad,
would be better off if he could put his extra money to other
uses, the Republicans could cry “But without the tariff he
would have no twenty dollars, he would have no ten, for he
would have no work!” The fallacy that there would be
nothing to do in the country if protection did not enable men
to manufacture was insisted on continually. Moreover, the
Republicans would not admit what was, and still is, true, that
the great body of wages in protected industries is less than in
the unprotected. The trusts figured repeatedly in the attack
on the Republican position, only to be waved aside, as
by Mr. Blaine. “Trusts,” he declared, “are state issues,”
“they have no place in a national campaign.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Republicans were not without good ammunition.
The Democratic revision was full of inconsistencies as any
revision made as ours are, is bound to be. It did show geographic
bias. Moreover, the Democratic position had the
disadvantage of being an attempt to meet a condition and one
not of their making. They might be free traders as a few of
them were; they might be tariff-for-revenue only men, as
most of them were, but when it came to making a tariff bill
they felt themselves obliged to fix duties not only with revenue
and reform in mind, but with protection as well. The Republicans
could taunt them with inconsistency and cowardice
and describe their revenue duties as disguised protection to
their own friends. And in the same breath that they accused
them of protecting their friends they anathematized them
as “free-traders,” friends of England, enemies of their own
countrymen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Republicans won the election, though not overwhelmingly.
As a matter of fact, Grover Cleveland had a majority
of 100,000 of the popular vote. It was not the tariff which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>gave them the victory. Their victory would have been a
defeat if it had not been for the Democratic split which gave
them New York, and the return to their fold of a certain
Mugwump Republican element which had revolted in 1884
and now came back because dissatisfied with Mr. Cleveland’s
civil service work.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <span class='large'>THE McKINLEY BILL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>There has not been a presidential election in our time when
the tariff positions of the two great parties were as perfectly
defined as in 1888. Each had a bill practically complete to
offer the country. The Republicans had elected a president
and the majority of the House of Representatives. It was
natural that they should now demand that their bill be at
once adopted. Although the Allison Bill had been practically
finished before the election, it had not been sent to the House,
because it was claimed that the Democrats were malicious
enough and Mr. Cleveland clever enough to pass it in order to
have a completed reform to go to the country on. The Senate
bill being what we have seen, and Mr. Carlisle and Mr.
Mills being the leaders of the House, such action was of course
unthinkable, but it was an excuse as good as another for not
sending in the bill, and no doubt was accepted by the devout.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as Congress met in December the Allison Bill was
taken up, again compared with the Mills Bill, and finally on
January 22 passed as an amendment to the latter. In sending
the bill over to the House the Senate suggested that it
be referred to a Conference Committee of the two Houses.
This was to avoid the objection the Democrats were sure to
raise, that the Allison Bill was a violation of the Constitutional
provision that all revenue measures must originate with the
House. Mr. Reed and Mr. McKinley both urged the Conference.
To Mr. Reed it was an absurdity that the rules in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>force could prevent prompt action. At least if the Democrats
did refuse to allow a conference on the bill, he wanted to
make sure that the country understood that it was not the
Republicans who were delaying action in the all-important
matter of reducing the revenue; it was the Democrats, the
very gentlemen who had so long and so loudly urged the
necessity of action!</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. McKinley’s proposition sounded reasonable. “The
House,” he said, “has given to the country one bill framed
upon one principle and based upon the line of party policy
with which the majority is in accord. The Senate has given
to the country another bill resting upon an entirely different
principle and following out an entirely different line of public
and party policy. The Senate has asked the House to consent
to a committee of conference to consider the disagreement so
presented, that they may see if in some manner this great difference
between the two Houses cannot be reconciled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, what do we want to do as practical men? What
does the country expect of us? We want to reduce the
public revenues and we can reduce them without my friend
from Texas being called upon to surrender one jot of his free-trade
principles or this side surrendering one jot of its protection
principles. If the House of Representatives meets
the Senate in free and open conference and those provisions
are adopted where the two bills meet on common ground, we
can reduce the revenues from thirty-five to forty millions of
dollars and still preserve for future settlement the general
policy of taxation respectively adhered to by the two parties.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All we have to do, Mr. Speaker, is to take up these two
bills and look at the duties and changes in rates which are
common to both. First, the abolition of the tax upon tobacco—$30,000,000;
that is common to both bills. Then you
take the free list; that is common to both bills. Then you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>take the administrative features of both bills. Both seek
the same purpose; both look to an honest collection of the
revenue and an honest administration of the customs laws.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This administrative bill has nothing to do with politics;
it has nothing to do with free trade; it has nothing to do with
protection; it has nothing to do with party principles or
policies. It is above politics and should be divorced from
party. But it has everything to do with an honest administration
of the customs laws, whether they are based upon
the principle of protection or upon the principle of free trade.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, why not, as practical men, seeking to relieve the
Treasury of the United States of its congestion, as described
by the President of the United States, meet this condition
and relieve the Treasury of its accumulating surplus and
leave this vast sum of money with the people, where it
belongs? ‘It is not a theory; it is a condition.’ Shall we
run away from the condition which we can in part relieve, or
waste our valuable time now upon theory?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The answers of Mr. Mills and his supporters to these arguments
were as indignant as to be expected. “Mr. Speaker,”
said Mr. Mills, “we have sent to the Senate a bill to reduce
taxation. They had originated in that Chamber, or were
preparing before we sent this bill to them, in defiance of the
Constitution, a bill increasing taxation on the people of this
country, an act which they were prohibited by the great
charter of our fathers from doing. They have sent that bill
so prepared here in defiance of the rules of this House, and
it is now proposed that we accept their invitation to appoint
a committee of conference and pass this extraordinary measure,
and that, too, at a time when the coffers of this Government
are loaded with the excess of revenue, at a time when
the people of this country are groaning with unnecessary
taxation; a bill to reduce the revenues by destroying the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>commerce of the country and increasing the load of taxation
upon the people for private purposes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. McMillan was equally severe: “The gentleman from
Ohio (Mr. McKinley) has not even pretended that this Senate
bill is an ‘amendment’ to the House bill. He could not.
He is too intelligent to believe it and too candid to assert it.
It is, as he describes it, an entirely different bill; a distinct
proposition framed on a different ‘theory.’ As a matter of
fact, the Senate does not assume to amend the House bill.
The Senate struck out every section of our bill or threw it
aside and framed one of their own. In doing so they violated
the Constitution, and they now ask us to meet them in
conference and concur in this demolition.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What I want to know of the members of this House is,
are you ready to do this in the face of that declaration of the
gentleman from Ohio that this is a different and new bill?
Have you so far degenerated from those principles that your
sires held of adherence to the Constitution as to be willing at
the request of the gentleman from Ohio to give up the people’s
right to frame a bill in accordance with the people’s principles,
and give it over to the Senate, not elected by the people
directly, but by the states? Others may do as they please,
but for me, I will never, never consent to such a cowardly
and ignoble degradation of the rights of the people and the
privileges of the House.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Allison Bill went to the Ways and Means Committee
and that was the last of it under the name of the gentleman
who had led in its making.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not until a year after its election that the new House
got a chance at the tariff. In his first message to Congress
President Harrison had recommended a revision of both the
schedules and the administrative features of the tariff. He
feared, he said, that some disturbance of business might result
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>from the consideration of the subject, but he was certain that
this would be reduced to the minimum by “the assurance
which the country already enjoys that any necessary changes
will be so made as not to impair the just and reasonable protection
of our home industries.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The new organization of the House and of the Ways and
Means Committee was admirably adapted to put through a
bill satisfactory to the dominant faction of the party—also a
bill in which the manufacturer would get what he asked. The
chairman of the Committee was no longer William Kelley.
Mr. Kelley was in his last illness and the man who for nearly
six years had been his chief lieutenant had taken his place.
This was William McKinley of Ohio. In 1883, it will be
remembered, Mr. Kelley thought he had found his successor
in William D. Haskell of Kansas. Mr. Haskell had shown
unusual ability both as a parliamentarian and a debater, but
the work of the session had been too much for him. He did
not recuperate from the strain through the summer, and
twelve days after Congress opened in December, he died in
Washington. Kelley wept like a child when he heard of
Haskell’s death. “Why could not I have gone in his place,”
he said; “my work is nearly done, his was only begun.” But
Kelley was not alone. Close to Haskell throughout the winter
of 1882–1883 had been another young protectionist, one in
whom Kelley had great and affectionate confidence. This
was William McKinley. Indeed, it had been uncertain at the
beginning of the movement for tariff reform in 1880, whether
Haskell or McKinley would become Kelley’s first lieutenant.
The former had won by his superior energy and superior intellect
and it is altogether probable that he would have kept
his place if he had lived. At his death McKinley naturally
succeeded him. At that time he was about forty-five years
old. He had been in Congress since 1876, and from the first the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>tariff had been his chief interest. His amiability, his earnestness,
his almost devout attitude towards the dogma of protection,
endeared him greatly to Kelley, and by the time the
debate on the Mills Bill came on he was firmly in place. His
speeches in that debate and the campaign which followed
were among the most popular made. McKinley had an advantage
at that time which few of his colleagues enjoyed,—that
of believing with childlike faith that all he claimed for
protection was true. Moreover, he had no tariff reform record
behind him as the best of them had; no speech like Allison’s
of March, 1870, could be thrown up at him. Moreover, McKinley
was one of those amiable persons who likes to agree
with everybody, and even when President, rarely sent away
a visitor without making him feel that they agreed more than
they differed. He was friendly with many of the Democrats,
particularly Colonel Mills, and often consulted him at vexing
points. Believing, as McKinley did, in the infallibility of protection,
there could not be too much of it; he could with
clear conscience give all that the manufacturer asked, and
then add a little, confident that he was really fostering prosperity.</p>

<p class='c007'>But at this particular moment it needed something more
than an ardent and amiable chairman to put through the
House of Representatives such a bill as it was obvious would
be reported. There was a majority of but twenty-one, and
with the rules as they were, almost endless obstruction was
possible. The probability was, too, that the Democrats
would see that all the obstruction possible was applied. The
speaker the Republicans had chosen could be counted to take
care of this situation. This was Thomas B. Reed of Maine.
Mr. Reed was, like McKinley, a protectionist, but he never
regarded the dogma as inspired. His well-developed humor,
his cynicism, and his large practical sense all helped him to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>view it for about what it was worth. But that made him no
less strenuous a supporter. Indeed, it made him a more adroit
and effective one. You could tell beforehand about what
phraseology Kelley or McKinley would offer in defence of
a schedule. Reed could be counted on for the unexpected.
He had no patience with delaying the tariff bill. He believed
in doing what the majority wanted done,—when he agreed
with the majority,—and he laid down at the start in defiance
of precedent a set of orders which enabled him to force rapid
action.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Mr. McKinley called the Committee on Ways and
Means, it had before it two bills carefully prepared by members
of his own party, providing for what President Harrison
had pointed out in his message should be done. These were
Mr. Allison’s Customs Administrative Bill, which after passing
the Senate had been referred to the Committee nearly two
years earlier (March, 1888), and the same Senator’s Tariff bill
which in January of 1889 had been referred to the House
as an amendment to the Mills Bill. Both of these measures
were thoroughly familiar to Congress and the country. McKinley
seems to have had the idea at first of making a tariff
bill which would include administration as well as duties, but
Colonel Tichenor, who had been appointed Assistant Secretary
of the Treasury in charge of customs and internal revenue,
urged so hard for immediate action on the Administrative Bill
that McKinley finally introduced it separately and it was
promptly passed and signed by the President. This is practically
the law under which our customs are still administered.
It is usually credited to Mr. McKinley, but with its
framing he had, as we have seen, very little to do.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hearings on the tariff were at once begun. They perhaps
were never less justifiable. The Committee had as a guide a
great mass of recent testimony which further hearings could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>do little more than duplicate. But Mr. McKinley took the
whole matter too devoutly to omit any of the ceremony.
Hearings were a good Republican tradition, and hearings he
would have. His was to be no “Dark Lantern bill,” as the
opposition delighted in calling the Mills Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Allison Bill was accepted as a foundation by Mr.
McKinley for the new measure which was first reported on
April 16. In reporting the bill Mr. McKinley gave notice
that general debate would be limited to four days. “I have
interpreted the victory to mean, and the majority in the
House and Senate to mean,” he said, “that a revision of the
tariff was not only demanded by the votes of the people but
that such revision should be on the line and in full recognition
of the principle and purposes of protection. The people have
spoken and want their will registered and their decrees embodied
in public legislation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Mills and his colleagues were eloquent in their remonstrances
against the limit on the debate, but the program
was in too firm hands to be modified by arguments or tactics.
The bill passed the House on May 21. The Senate Committee
on Finance added hundreds of amendments to it, and
the Senate spent some seven weeks debating it. On the
10th of September it passed the upper House and was referred
to a Conference Committee. Both Houses agreed to
the report of this Committee, and the President signed the
bill and it became a law on October 1, 1890.</p>

<p class='c007'>The matter of first moment in the new bill was of course
the method taken for reducing the surplus, which had been
piling up in an alarming fashion throughout the three years’
struggle. When Mr. Cleveland made his demand in 1887
for general tariff reduction in order to bring this overtaxation
down to a normal figure, the Republicans had offered as a
counter proposition—“spend it.” Mr. Blaine started the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>cry in his letter from Paris suggesting one of the most dubious
schemes for handling revenues ever proposed by an
American public man of any weight. It was to appropriate the
whiskey tax (the internal revenue tax on distilled spirits
amounted in 1888 to over $69,000,000) to coast fortifications.
If there was something over after this was done and the National
government had no use for the money, he would divide
it among the Federal Union, with the specific object of lightening
the tax on real estate. Mr. Blaine evidently had forgotten
for the moment that the Constitution in defining the
taxing powers of Congress does not include that of “lightening
the tax on real estate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There had been various other plans offered. Mr. Aldrich
would apply the surplus to the purchase of United States
bonds, or as a prepayment of interest on the National debt.
One Congressman wanted it applied in bounties to wheatgrowers,
another wished it loaned, another would devote it
to building the Ead’s ship railway, several proposed using it
in elaborate educational schemes. The general consent that
the best way to get rid of it was to spend it, of course made
Congress reckless in appropriations, particularly of pensions.
They jumped from $87,500,000 to about $107,000,000 in
Harrison’s first year, and in his fourth year, they had risen to
$159,000,000. But spending it was not enough. The taxes
must come down some $60,000,000 a year and the Republican
suggestion had been, “cut down the internal revenue.” The
Republican platform declared, “We favor the entire repeal
of internal taxes rather than the surrender of any part of our
protective system.” Mr. Allison and his committee considered
many suggestions for the repeal of all internal revenue
taxes but stopped after taking them off tobacco. Mr. McKinley
announced that he had not been compelled to abolish
the internal revenue though he was ready to do so if it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>necessary to save the protective system. He estimated that
the taxes on tobacco and alcohol used in the arts, which his
bill did abolish, would amount to $10,000,000. The other
$50,000,000 of reductions he proposed to meet in two ways.
The first was by so increasing duties that importations would
fall off, <i>i.e.</i> Mr. McKinley accepted the principle of Mr.
Kelley and Mr. Aldrich that the way to reduce revenue from
customs is to make foreign goods which might compete with
domestic products too dear to buy. When the Democrats
attacked his increase with the assertion that he would increase
taxation and so revenue, he answered: “That statement is entirely
misleading. It can only be accepted upon the assumption
that the importation of the present year under this bill,
if it becomes a law, will be equal to the importations of like
articles under the existing law; and there is not a member of
the Committee of Ways and Means, there is not a member of
the minority of that Committee, there is not a member of the
House on either side, who does not know that the very instant
that you have increased the duties to a fair protective
point, putting them above the highest revenue point, that
very instant you diminish importations and to that extent
diminish the revenue.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The chief articles which he hoped to make too dear to import
were woollens and higher grade cottons, cotton knit goods,
stockings, linens, and all iron and steel and metal products,
the articles, it will be noted, which are essential to everybody.
It was not necessary to raise the rates on all these products
to make them too dear to import. Not a few rates then in
force could be lowered and still be prohibitive. Thus in
the case of structural steel and steel rails, the McKinley
bill reduced the existing rate slightly without in the least disturbing
the situation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. McKinley’s pet duty in the metal schedule, and indeed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>in the bill, was that on tin plate. There had been a duty of a
cent a pound on tin plate for some years and throughout
much of this period there had been a steady pressure to raise
it to 2½ or 2½ cents. In the early ’70’s there had been a little
tin plate manufactured in the country. The price at the
time had been abnormally high on account of the Franco-Prussian
War and the premium on gold. When things
dropped back to normal, the industry lagged. But the
would-be manufacturers—and many makers of iron plates
naturally wanted to turn them into tin plates—for ten years
at least had kept up an agitation. The tariff commission of
’82, through Commissioner Oliver’s influence probably, had
advised 2½ cents, but Congress refused to raise the duty in the
Bill of 1883. The Tin Plate Association and the Iron and
Steel Association continued their work. An increased duty
on tin plate became, in a way, in the ’80’s, a test of a Republican’s
soundness in the minds of the big interest which had
put themselves behind the party. If he hesitated, recalled
that we had developed no tin mines, that inevitably the price
would be higher for a long term, that such a duty would be a
blow to an industry many times greater than tin plate could
ever be,—that of canning,—that the burden would fall directly
on the poor, they being the chief consumers of tin
buckets, and cups, of canned fish, meat, and vegetables—the
answer was the answer of “Pig Iron” Kelley!—“In God’s
name do not let the gentleman lead us to declare that the
people of this country shall never manufacture tin plate!”</p>

<p class='c007'>With the Iron and Steel Association taking the important
place it did in the campaign of 1888, it was of course inevitable
that the Allison Bill should recognize its demand for an advance
on tin plate. Mr. McKinley found the duty then in the
bill he inherited and Mr. Allison, who believed sincerely that
the tariff on tin plate had justified itself, was sore to the day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>of his death because Mr. McKinley never credited it to the
Allison Bill. It is doubtful if an important duty was ever
laid on facts so distorted and in answer to pressure so questionable.
The chief advocate was the American Tin Plate
Association. Their circulars went out broadcast as appeals
to patriotism. “If this little circular should fall into the
hands of a patriotic lady or gentleman,” wrote the Secretary
in a circular which was printed in 1888, “we ask that you
kindly give this matter some study; it is a patriotic feeling
and nothing else that instigates the members of this association.”
The patriotic lady or gentleman who had given the
circular study would have found it started with a statement
so absurd that he would have only continued because of the
amusement he might get from it. According to this circular
we consumed about $35,000,000 worth of tin plate a year
(the figure was greatly exaggerated), and “if it were made in
this country several hundred thousand residents of the
United States would gain a livelihood thereby.” If the value
of the tin plate consumed were $35,000,000 and the sum was
divided into one-third for materials and two-thirds for wages
and the “several hundred thousands” were reckoned as
300,000, their annual wages would have been about $78.00
a year!</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. McKinley saw a wonderful future for the industry—23,000
men employed directly in the business (in 1900 there
were 4000; in 1905, 5000), $30,000,000 of capital invested
(in 1905 it was $10,000,000). He did not seem to think
there was any impropriety in a part of the capital ready to
go into tin plate making, being that of a member of the House
long a supporter of the duty, F. G. Niedringhaus, of Missouri.
This gentleman wrote on November 27 a letter read in Congress
by Mr. McKinley, saying one of his mills had been arranged
for tin plate work and in case of a “proper duty,” he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>could turn out tin plate on short order, and “if the fact as I
believe it to be can be generally established in the minds of
the people, <i>that the Republicans will continue to govern this
country in the future</i>, there will be plenty of money forthcoming
to embark in the manufacture of tin and terne plate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The violent attack upon this duty and the very plausible
reasons for believing that the industry could never be selfsupporting,
led to the adopting of an ingenious provision,
limiting the time that manufacturers might have to establish
the business. Tin plate was to be admitted free of duty
after October 1, 1897, unless in some one of the years between
1891 (when the duty was to go into effect) and 1897, one-third
as much tin plate was produced here as was imported
in any one of the other six years. This clever device originated
with Senator Spooner of Wisconsin.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Tin Plate and Iron and Steel Associations practically
wrote their own schedules in the McKinley Bill. The wool
growers and woollen manufacturers did the same. A series
of poor years in wool occurred in the ’80’s. There were legitimate
causes outside of the tariff for the depression, but a
large and influential part of the industry believed or professed
to believe the trouble to come solely from reductions in duties
made in 1883. These reductions had disturbed the “harmony”
in wool which they claimed the growers and manufacturers
had established in 1867, and which they now loudly
affirmed must be restored if the two branches of the industry
were again to be prosperous. There were long petitions presented
by manufacturers asking for free wool, arguing that the
industry could never hope to compete until it was on an equal
footing with other nations in the matter of raw materials; but
this point of view was not supported by the National Association
of Wool Manufacturers, which by this time had become
one of the most powerful political organizations in American
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>industry. It held that the manufacturer must support the
duty on wool if he did not wish to set the growers against the
duty on woollens. It had been established in 1867 “almost
as economic law,” Mr. Whitman, the president of the organization
claimed, that the wool-grower was to have his duty,
and that the wool manufacturer was to be given two kinds
of duties, one which would compensate him fully for the tariffs
on his raw materials, not only wool but dyestuffs, and that
after that, he was to have the same measure of protection that
other industries received. Mr. Whitman claimed that the
lowering of the compensating duty in 1883 had particularly
disturbed the “economic law.” As we have seen, this duty
had been dropped from 50 to 35 cents. In making this drop
the Committee had decided that it was a mistake to count
4 pounds of grease wool to one pound of cloth as had been
done in 1867, since 4 pounds were rarely used. It had said
that 3½ pounds was a generous allowance—as it was. Mr.
Whitman remonstrated against this decreased compensation.
He wanted the duty based on the 4 pounds and he wanted
other upward revisions. The program proposed by the Association
was practically adopted. It contained one curious
provision new to the wool schedule and important in the
later history of the tariff; that was a duty on tops and all
wools and hair advanced beyond a washed condition. Tops
are wool in one of the early stages on the way to yarn. Mr.
Whitman, asked how the cost of making tops compared with
that of making yarn, said it was about one-half. In the
same examination Mr. Whitman also said the principle which
he wished applied in the fixing of the duties was that there
should be a higher duty on cloth than yarn, on clothing than
cloth, and he suggested that the relative per cent of the three
should be 40 per cent for yarn, 50 per cent for cloth, and 60 per
cent for clothing. As to tops, which could be made according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>to Mr. Whitman at one-half the expense of yarn, he suggested
for them a duty <i>not</i> lower, as one would expect from the “principle”
he had himself laid down, nor indeed did he fix a direct
duty. Mr. Whitman suggested that the rate on tops be that
fixed for the basket or catch-all clause of the schedule. Turning
to that clause we find it to be not <i>less</i> than the rate on
yarn, but considerably <i>more</i>. The suggestion was embodied
in the McKinley Bill apparently without anybody except Mr.
Whitman understanding its motive. Other suggestions of
the manufacturers were also adopted, resulting in increased
protection on those classes of goods where there was any
amount of importation. Generally speaking, the efforts of
the manufacturers was to secure advances in both the wool
and cotton schedules where competition still persisted.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wool growers were equally successful. The duties
were raised on the various classes of wool. Moreover, the
duty on shoddy, mungo, and wool wastes which had been
low were raised so high that importation became impossible.
This change was made on the imperative demand of the Ohio
“Wool Trinity,” who declared these substances were taking
the place of pure wool and so injuring the wool-grower. The
same argument was largely responsible for an increased
duty on carpet wool. We grow no carpet wool in this country
and probably can never afford to do so, our land and labor
being too valuable. The wool-growers contended, however,
that the manufacturer was using carpet wool in making cloth
and that they must be protected against this injustice. It
is probable that considerable carpet wool does find its way
into some grades of cloth, but not enough to have any effect
on domestic wool production.</p>

<p class='c007'>The largest lump of reduction provided for in the new bill
came by making raw sugar free and by reducing the duty on
refined sugar to one-half a cent a pound. The revenue from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>sugar was so great, about $55,000,000 annually in this period,
that the schedule had been a favorite point of attack for
years, when reduction was necessary. There were two difficulties
in the way of the Republican protectionist in reducing
the duty on raw sugar. The American sugar cane and American
sugar beet growers under the high duty which they had
been enjoying had come in 1890 to produce about one-seventh
of the sugar we used. This amounted to something like
220,000 tons. Of this amount only a little over 3000 tons
were made from beets and sorghum. Small as was the
amount, the beet and sorghum advocates were as insistent in
their demands for protection as the tin plate people. The
Kansas (sorghum) and California (beet sugar) Congressmen
were certain that, properly protected, these states would produce
great quantities of sugar, and it is pretty certain that
they were ready to fight the tin plate, wool, cotton, or any
other duty if their demands were not granted. Take care of
them and they would soon grow all the sugar the United
States could eat, they said. Their product, small as it was,
caused high protectionists like Kelley, Haskell, and McKinley
to rejoice. It was proof of what they claimed—protection
did diversify industry, and Kelley, at least, always carried in
his pocket a sample of beet sugar raised in this country to
show to the doubting. At the same time even Kelley and
McKinley found it hard to defend a tax of $55,000,000 a year,
to protect an industry which after a century’s experience had
been able to supply no more than one-seventh of our wants.
The sugar bill was really staggering when it came to be
counted up for the century as one advocate of free sugar did;
he estimated we had paid $1,400,000,000 in the period. To cut
down this tax and at the same time to satisfy the growers,
Mr. McKinley proposed that raw sugar should be free and that
the sugar-growers should receive a bounty. The idea did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>not originate with his committee. It had been a provision of
the Allison Bill to which Mr. Allison confessed he came slowly,
but which he had consented to try “as an experiment.” It
had been a hobby of various members for years. John Sherman
had long believed in sugar bounties and had often advocated
them. In 1888 Joseph Cannon of Illinois had proposed
a bill providing for free sugar and bounties for growers.
There were many Republicans who baulked at the idea, declaring
it unconstitutional. They might not object to an
indirect tax like a custom duty, being so applied as to subsidize
the man’s business, but when it came to appropriating
undisguisedly to this purpose funds raised by taxation they
could not consent. It was a case of a distinction without a
difference, however, and as they became familiar with the
idea the scruples of many of them, enough of them at least,
to pass the bill, seem to have disappeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bounty provision gave a fine opportunity to Mr. Mills.
According to his way of thinking it was a “bribe,” an “extortion,”
a violation of the Constitution, and where might it not
lead? Why should not everybody have it? Why should
not the “people who are raising corn, cotton, wheat, oats,
hogs, and beeves, all slip up the counter and say ‘we will take
sugar in ours, too.’” It is difficult to believe that the sugar
bounty could have survived a test before the Supreme Court.
The Constitution is quite clear in the definition of the taxing
powers it gives to Congress. It is for the “general welfare.”
If this means anything, it means that the tax shall be for a
public purpose; or, as Richard Olney has defined it, “It is
the power to raise money from the public for the public.”
No stretch of the Constitution could include in this definition
the power of raising money to help a few farmers raise sugar
beets and sorghum, any more than it could to pension an
artist while he learned to paint.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>The duty fixed on refined sugar in the McKinley Bill was
intended as an attack on the monopolistic powers of the so-called
“Sugar Trust.” The official name of the sugar trust
in 1890 was the Sugar Refineries Company. It had been
formed in 1887, but the operations of the leading concerns
which organized it had long been a scandal. In those years,
as now, these beneficiaries of the nation’s tariff policy had
worked in every conceivable way to avoid paying the duty
on their imported raw sugar. False weighing, under-classification,
over rebate duties for drawbacks on exports, adulterations,
were methods they practised boldly and repeatedly in
the ’70’s and ’80’s in their effort to cheat the government. The
sugar schedule had lent itself admirably to the manipulation.
The aim of the trust was, of course, to keep out all sugar
which was eatable, <i>i.e.</i> they aimed to supply the country.
Now the line between refined and unrefined sugar is difficult to
draw strictly. There are high grade clean raw sugars, and
partially refined sugars which may be used without further
treatment. These sugars are of course cheap and bought by
the poor. The refiners aim to keep the duty on this class of
sugars, known in the schedule as Nos. 13 to 16, Dutch Standard
(the Dutch Standard is a color test) so high that it will
not pay to put them on the market. In the bill of 1883 they
had succeeded in doing this. The sugar refiners had not only
manipulated the duty on this class of sugar until it was too
dear to eat, but they had practised some of their most successful
frauds in this region of the sugar schedule. A sample
of their operations had been presented to the Senate only
a short time before by Secretary Fairchild. It related to a
cargo of sugar brought into San Francisco by the American
Sugar Refinery (the Spreckles concern). In this case the
enterprising importers caused the sugar to be artificially
colored in order to reduce the grade below No. 13, Dutch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>Standard. They had also caused it to be invoiced at 88
degrees, but its actual strength was found to be from 96 to 98
degrees. The attempted fraud made a difference of $61,000
in the duty. The American Sugar Refinery was caught in
this instance, but there is no doubt that tricks of this sort had
been frequently successful. To take away the duty on these
grades then would not only serve the poor, but it would also
go far towards breaking up the monopoly. The independent
refiners themselves had in the recent hearings advised this.
“The remedy for the monopoly in sugar is in your hands absolutely,”
one of the independents told the Ways and Means
Committee; “that is by putting just so much duty and no more
on refined sugar, that if we undertake to get more profit than
we ought, England, Germany, and France can send in their
refined sugars. The remedy is entirely with you and we expect
you to apply it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The way in which Mr. McKinley proposed to reach the
abuses was to make all sugar below No. 16, Dutch Standard
free. Here again the provision was not original. It had
been in the first drafts of both the Mills and Allison Bills, but
had been so strenuously fought by the sugar interests that it
had been dropped in both cases. When this provision of the
McKinley Bill reached the Senate it met the opposition of the
same gentleman who had been most influential in raising the
rates in the Allison Bill, Nelson W. Aldrich. Mr. Aldrich
moved that Nos. 13 to 16 be made dutiable. Senators Sherman
and Allison both fought him, but Aldrich carried the
day. His power at that time, however, was not great enough
to rule the conference to which the bill was finally submitted,
and the original House arrangement was adopted and became
the law.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no industrial development related to the tariff
which gave the Republicans deeper concern at this period
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>than the trusts. Mr. Cleveland in his message of 1887 had
called attention to the aid a high duty gave to combinations
struggling for the entire control of a commodity, and the
country could not but see that he was right. There was a
type of protectionist who refused to admit the connection.
According to Mr. Kelley and Mr. Aldrich there could be no
monopoly in a protected article. Domestic competition
would prevent it. Nevertheless the trusts multiplied and
the majority of them were in highly protected industries.
Moreover, it was obvious that if there was no duty, the industry
would have to sustain a competition which would
make monopoly very difficult if not impossible. It was not
the Democrats alone who saw this. Senator Sherman, who felt
particular anxiety over the question, which he realized might
easily defeat the party if it were not settled, thought and said
frequently before 1889 that the trust could only be reached
through the revenue laws. He had been ready to take all
duty from refined sugar in order to destroy the sugar trust,
but the majority of his party did not agree with him. They
hesitated at admitting a connection between anything so
unpopular as a trust and anything so sacred and infallible as
protection. An effort was made to dismiss the troublesome
phenomenon as of no consequence. Mr. Blaine tried this.
“Trusts,” he said, “were state issues.” “They have no place
in a national campaign.” In mentioning them he would put
in the proviso, “<i>If</i> they are evils,” etc. But this was no more
effective than the similar attempt to make people believe that
the surplus was a good thing, a proof of prosperity. The
unrest increased rather than diminished, and numerous bills
were introduced into Congress between 1887 and 1890, aimed
at defining, regulating, or suppressing combinations. Bills
to tax, to take the tariff from, to investigate and to forbid
trusts, pepper the proceedings. Among these bills was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>measure of Senator Sherman’s making a combination in
restraint of trade a crime punishable by fine or imprisonment.
This was first introduced in 1888. It was repeatedly discussed
and amended, and now that the tariff revision was on,
it was felt that it should be passed. The Democrats did not
hesitate to declare that the Republicans’ sudden zeal for the
bill was due to their desire to have an answer for those who
might criticise their tariff bill as a trust-breeder. At all events,
the measure was passed ahead of the tariff bill. Thus an
answer was ready for the critics. As Senator Morgan said,
“The bill was a good preface to an argument upon the protective
tariff.”</p>

<p class='c007'>More difficult to meet than any other criticism on high
protection had always been the fact of the burden it put upon
the farmer. Practically everything he had to buy was made
dearer by the import duties. His domestic market was undoubtedly
enlarged by the stimulus the tariff gave to manufacturers.
There were more buyers at home for his products,
but they paid the prices of the open-world market. There
was no protection for his corn or wheat or barley or potatoes,
nor was it generally of an advantage to him that there should
be. He was the great exporter of the United States. He
produced more than we could consume, and sold abroad. His
prices were generally not made here but in the London market.
In the cases where we did import agricultural products, high
duties had not been levied for the good reason that they would
make the necessities of life dearer. It would be a tax on food,
and there had always been a reluctance to imposing that. If
we did not raise potatoes enough for our people and must
import, should we penalize the consumer because the farmer
had failed to take advantage of the market at his door?
Should we penalize him for the crop failure which might occur
at any time? But, argued the protectionist of 1890, we are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>buying too much food abroad. What are we building up the
home market for unless that it may supply all its needs from
the home farmer, and it is not doing so. In 1889, said Mr.
McKinley, we bought $256,000,000 worth of agricultural
products abroad. This should be stopped. It was unjust to
the farmer. When the figures Mr. McKinley quoted are
analyzed they are less impressive, for upward of $200,000,000
of the importations were sugar, tea, coffee, and articles which
we did not produce or in very small quantities, <i>i.e.</i> they were
articles which the American farmer as well as factory hand
must import if he uses them at all. This fact was slurred over
in the argument. We were buying $256,000,000 worth of
agricultural products abroad. The domestic market was not
doing its duty by the farmer; that duty was to supply all
its needs at home. The only reason it was not doing this was
because there was too low a duty on the farmer’s products.
The factory hands must be forced to buy home-grown potatoes,
eggs, and meats. It was as logical, of course, to force the
public at large to eat only home-grown food as it was to force
the farmer to buy only home-made iron and steel. So in the
interests of the farmer the McKinley bill for the first time
in our tariff history taxed food generally and heavily. Eggs
which had been free, 5 cents a dozen; potatoes, 25 cents a
bushel; bacon, 5 cents a pound; barley, 30 cents a bushel.
With this program the Republicans hoped to quiet the farmer’s
discontent.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a political manœuvre pure and simple. No tariffs
can protect the farmer’s products save locally and sporadically.
His is the basic world industry. The inhabitants of
the earth, <i>all</i> the earth, not a corner of it, are his market.
The most imperious cry of men, that for food, calls him.
Laws as all-powerful as gravitation govern him. Petty and
temporary interferences like tariffs may hinder his labors for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>a season, but the word of the Almighty is his guarantee that
the little schemes of men to keep the fulness of the earth
from its creatures are bound to end in confusion. Already
the farmers had striking proof that the radical interference
with the laws of supply and demand, which had been forced
upon the country by the Civil War and which had been kept
alive since by a combination of greed, superstition, politics,
and loose thinking, were telling on his industry. The entire
agricultural production of 1890 was worth only about ten
per cent more than that of 1890, but the population had
increased some twenty-five per cent. That which had been
repeatedly prophesied had happened. The privileges
granted to manufacturers had enticed capital from the
farms and men from the soil. It was natural that this
should be so. Effort will go where the way is made easiest
and the results are quickest. There was sound reason
in the charge of the free trader. You have ruined our
commerce on the high seas, now you are injuring our
agriculture.</p>

<p class='c007'>Moreover, nations will not buy freely of nations that close
their doors. The country was beginning to feel this fact. We
were antagonizing the foreign market. The member of the
Harrison Administration who saw this fact most clearly was
James G. Blaine, Secretary of State. Mr. Blaine had been
guilty of some curious quakery in the campaign for tariff
reform, which Mr. Cleveland had forced. His treatment of
the surplus and the trust in their relation to the tariff had
been superficial. But to the question of our foreign trade he
had given serious thought. He saw clearly enough that increased
duties would injure trade and that limiting our trade
would hurt the Republican party. There was no mistaking
the sentiment of the country on the need of extending foreign
markets. Mr. Blaine feared above all things to excite further
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>suspicion that the new bill would be to decrease rather than
to increase them. Before the measure had even been reported
he made at least one strong protest against a proposed duty
on an article heretofore free. This was the duty on hides.
For over twenty-five years hides had been free and we had
been importing large quantities from South America. The
demand for a duty came from the cattle-growers of the West
and Mr. McKinley proposed to grant it. When Mr. Blaine
heard of this he wrote a letter to Mr. McKinley so sound
that one can hardly believe it to be from the same man who
had proposed to perpetuate an exorbitant surplus and use it
to fortify American cities.</p>

<p class='c012'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Mr. McKinley</span>:—It is a great mistake to take hides from
the free list, where they have been for so many years. It is a slap
in the face of the South Americans, with whom we are trying to
enlarge our trade. It will benefit the farmer by adding five to
eight per cent to the price of his children’s shoes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It will yield a profit to the butcher (Beef Trust) only, the last
man that needs it. The movement is injudicious from beginning
to end—in every form and phase.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Please stop it before it sees light. Such movements as this for
protection will protect the Republican party only into speedy
retirement.</p>

      <div class='line in4'>“<span class='sc'>James G. Blaine</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This letter was dated April 10, six days before Mr. McKinley
reported his bill. It was effective. Hides were kept
on the free list in 1890.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the debate on the bill went on, Mr. Blaine appears to
have become more and more uneasy as to its effect on foreign
trade, and to meet the difficulty he proposed a system of what
might be called forced reciprocity with the countries of the
American Hemisphere. So long as they admitted free to their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>ports all the products of the United States our market should
be open and free to their products; but if they applied their
tariffs to our goods or put export duty on their own, they
should not enjoy the advantages of our free list. This proposition
was made in a report to President Harrison and by
him sent to Congress. It caused much discussion and Mr.
Blaine was obliged to explain himself repeatedly. On July 11,
he wrote Senator Frye, saying:</p>

<p class='c012'>“The charge against the protective policy which has injured
it most is that its benefits go wholly to the manufacturer and the
capitalist and not at all to the farmer. Here is an opportunity
where the farmer may be benefited—primarily, undeniably,
richly benefited. Here is an opportunity for a Republican Congress
to open the markets of forty millions of people to the products
of American farms. Shall we seize the opportunity, or shall we
throw it away?</p>

<p class='c014'>“I do not doubt that the tariff bill pending in the Senate is a
just measure, and that most of its provisions are in accordance
with the wise policy of protection. But there is not a section or a
line in the entire bill that will open the market for another bushel
of wheat or another barrel of pork.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Blaine in another letter said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“If, in the pending tariff, sugar is placed upon the free list, we
give to certain countries a free market for $95,000,000 of their
products, while they are not asked to open their markets to the
free admission of a single dollar of American products. We ought
to have, in exchange for free sugar from certain countries, a free
market for breadstuffs and provisions, besides various fabrics
from all parts of our country. In short, we ought to secure, in
return for free sugar, a market for $60,000,000 or $70,000,000 of our
own products. It will not require reciprocity treaties to secure
this boon. The tariff bill can contain all the necessary conditions.
The legislative power is able to secure the desired end. Within
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>the last twenty years we have given the countries south of us
free admission for nearly $60,000,000 worth of their products
without receiving a penny’s advantage in exchange. If sugar be
now made unconditionally free, we shall have given to the Latin-American
countries free admission for $150,000,000 of their products.
It is time, I think, to look out for some reciprocal advantages.
We are a very rich nation, but not rich enough to trade on
this equal basis.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Although Mr. Blaine’s idea was not adopted as he had presented
it, a reciprocity clause based on it was embodied in the
Tariff Act of 1890. This clause gave the President power to
impose duties on sugar, molasses, tea and coffee and hides, all
free in the McKinley Bill, if he found that a country which was
exporting any of these articles into the United States was
levying duties on the products of the United States which
seemed to him unjust. There was of course a lively skirmish
over giving the President this power. The Democrats declared
it unconstitutional and in this view they were supported
by Republican Senators as able as Mr. Edmunds and
Mr. Evarts; however, it became a law.</p>

<p class='c007'>As finally passed, the McKinley Bill was a complete victory
for that group of protectionists who had been struggling for
twenty-five years to force the Republican party to break the
pledges repeatedly given during and after the war to lower
the customs as rapidly as the financial condition of the country
would permit, to repudiate its long accepted moderate
interpretation of the doctrine, and to substitute for it the
teaching, that the wealth of this country had been produced
by protection and that its stability depended upon protection
being accepted as a permanent national economic policy. It
was equally a victory for the theorist like Kelley to whom
protection was sacred because he saw in it a panacea for
poverty, and for William Whitman and Joseph Wharton who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>saw fortunes for themselves in wool, nickel, iron, and steel if
they could secure the duties they asked. For John Sherman
and Morrill and Allison it was a half-victory only. They had
held moderate protection as the only wise and safe policy,
but they had been overruled.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most significant side to the victory was that it established
firmly the politico-industrial alliance which organizations
like the Industrial League, the Iron and Steel Association,
and the National Association of Wool Manufacturers had
worked so indefatigably ever since the war to build up. Moreover,
in the making of this bill, that alliance had found the
Congressional leader it needed—a man who was willing to
accept its dictates as to classifications and rates, to fight for
them with skill, energy, and technical knowledge, and who took
it as a matter of course that he and his party should receive in
exchange what financial and organizing aid they required.
This man was Nelson W. Aldrich. The part he had played
in the Senate in the making of the Allison and McKinley
Bills had proved him the first entirely able and what was quite
as important, entirely cynical leader, the high protectionists
had developed. Those whom he had served so well were not
ungrateful. Particularly jubilant was the National Association
of Wool Manufacturers. It publicly acknowledged its
“great obligations to Senator W. Aldrich of Rhode Island for
the masterly manner in which he advocated its cause in the
Senate.” “Indeed,” the Bulletin went on to say, “it is proper
that we should bear testimony in this connection to the remarkable
familiarity with all branches of industry displayed
by Senator Aldrich in his management of the tariff bill.
Every detail of the most complicated of the schedules was
present in his mind for instant response to any criticism or
inquiry. Day after day he stood at his post, alert and watchful,
rarely speaking except when a response was required, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>armed cap-à-pie for attack from any quarter. Rarely in the
history of tariff legislation in this country has the whole burden
of so protracted a debate fallen upon one man, and certainly
no representative in Congress ever acquitted himself more
admirably of so great a responsibility.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The best reason for believing that the methods and principles
embodied in the bill would have more than a brief life,
that the revolt already begun against its excesses and makeshifts
would not weaken it, lay in the fact that the ideal
leader for the measure had developed in the Senator from
Rhode Island.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <span class='large'>THE WILSON BILL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Gentlemen, you can pass your bill. You can pass it
when you please,” Colonel Roger Q. Mills told the Republicans
in Congress at the outset of the debate on the McKinley
Bill; “but whenever it does pass it will have a Hell Gate to
go through after it leaves the House and Senate. There is a
whirlpool with sunken rocks beneath the surface of the water
through which your little craft will have to sail.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You say that this question was settled at the last presidential
election. Yes, Grover Cleveland had a majority of
one hundred thousand votes of the American people. If there
is anything in the signs of the times, they indicate that that
majority will be greatly increased in the near future. I want
you to pass your bill and go with it out West; take it with
hair, hide, and wool all over it, and discuss it there; I want
you to meet the people whom you have ‘not hesitated’ to
tax from 1 to 200 per cent on the necessaries of life.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Chairman, we promise our friends that we will examine
their bill. It needs discussion, and will get whatever we
are permitted to give it; and then when we have done that
you will pass it, and when you leave this House and Senate
with this enormous load of guilt upon your heads and appear
before the great tribunal for trial, may ‘the Lord have mercy
upon your souls.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was in May of 1890. The bill became a law in October.
In the interval, wise Republicans like John Sherman and James
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>G. Blaine were doing their utmost to prepare for the passage
of the “Hell Gate,” which Colonel Mills had prophesied and
the roar of which became louder with each week’s approach
to the fall elections. While his party granted the duties
which bolstered the trusts, Mr. Sherman hurried through his
bill making trusts a crime. While his party raised higher the
wall which shut trade both in and out, Mr. Blaine worked for
free trade between ourselves and our neighbors on the American
hemisphere. But these were palliatives, not cures, and
sensible people recognized their character. The storm was
on the party almost as the measure went through. In the
Congress which passed the McKinley Bill, the Republicans
and Democrats stood 166 to 159. In the House of Representatives
elected a little over a month after the passage of the
McKinley Bill the proportion was 88 to 236: they had lost
78 votes. No such avalanche as overwhelmed the party in
the fall of 1890 is loosened by one cause. It is always a
number, but in this case it was a number of which the
prohibitive duty and the political methods it had required to
force it through Congress was the centre and strength. The
other causes were kindred in their nature. The overthrow
of the party at bottom was a plain revolt against the political
immorality, the intellectual humbug, and the unholy greed
which had produced the bill. At the heart of the Democratic
victory was the inspiration of a real cause. The defeat of ’88
had left the party determined rather than cast down. They
knew they were fighting for a right principle. Their joy in
the conflict grew rather than diminished as the months passed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Democrats had won the House and Senate and all the
indications were that they would win the presidency in 1892.
The first fifteen months’ trial of the new measure admirably
served their ambition, for that happened which, lack of work
aside, makes life hardest for the world in general,—the price
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>of food went steadily up. The fact that a dollar would buy
more sugar did not compensate for the fact that it bought
less flour, less corn-meal, less meat, and fewer potatoes.
Moreover, there were other advances which irritated the world
in general,—advances in the prices of coal, lumber, and particularly
tin ware and canned goods. Tin plates which sold
for $4.79 a box in 1890 sold for $5.33 in 1891, and by the time
the tin found its way into a milk pan or a dinner pail or a
tomato can there was a still greater per cent of increase. It
was so palpably a higher cost because of the duty, it was so
generally and correctly believed that the increase would not
for many years benefit more than a few, that irritation increased
with every purchase. Among manufactured goods
it was tin plates almost alone which advanced. Manufactured
goods generally fell in price in 1891. Some of the high grade
cottons and woollens advanced, but these were exceptions.
The fact of a decided increase in a common article like tin
plate, the fact that coal and lumber were dearer, quite overshadowed
the fall in the prices of goods generally.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no hesitation in the minds of the Democrats
about what they should do with their power when they took
possession of Congress in December, 1891. They proposed to
begin at once to reform the McKinley Bill. The history of
their efforts in the ’80’s being what we have seen, and Roger
Q. Mills being still a member of the House of Representatives,
it was to be expected that he would be elected speaker of the
House. Mills was a candidate, so were Charles F. Crisp of
Georgia and William M. Springer of Illinois. On the Tuesday
before the Democratic caucus, Colonel Mills had one
hundred and twenty votes pledged. When the first vote was
taken, Mr. Crisp was in the lead. On the thirtieth ballot
Mills was defeated by one vote. After the contest, he took
the Congressional Directory and checked off the names of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>twenty-four men who had asked him for committee assignments,
promising to support him in return; the doughty
Colonel had refused. Once in the contest Springer sent him
word that he would withdraw if Colonel Mills would make
him chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Colonel
Mills asked to have the proposition submitted in writing!
Tom Johnson, who was devoted to Mills, came to him once
when the balloting was going on, and said, “I do wish you
wouldn’t be a fool; give me two chairmanships and ask me
no questions and I will elect you on the next ballot.” The
Colonel only shook his head. There is no doubt that if he
had withdrawn with his followers from the caucus and thrown
the election into the House, the Republicans would have
elected him. Indeed, they so sent him word.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Crisp was elected, and he appointed Mr. Springer
chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. To Colonel
Mills he offered the second place on the Committee; this
Mills refused, “Having been a member of the committee of
the Ways and Means for ten years, and chairman in the fiftieth
Congress,” he wrote Mr. Springer, “the reasons which have
in your judgment rendered my appointment as chairman
unwise would disqualify me for service on any other part of
that Committee, and it would not be sincere to say that it
would be agreeable to accept your tender.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I leave to you, without suggestion from me, to make such
other arrangements as you, in the discharge of official duty,
may determine.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no possibility of any legislation passing beyond
the House in that session of Congress. A Republican Senate
and President stood in the way, but agitation for political
and educational purposes was possible and it was carried on.
Fully 150 petitions were presented the first session of the new
Congress, the 52d, December, 1891 to August, 1892, asking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>for the repeal of the whole or some part of the McKinley Bill.
More than 100 bills were introduced, providing for its repeal
or amendment. The Democrats undertook only the reform
of especially obnoxious duties. Five bills were brought in:
(1) a bill to place wool on the free list and to reduce the duty
on woollen goods; (2) a bill to admit free of duty bagging for
cotton, machinery for manufacturing bagging, cotton-ties and
cotton-gins; (3) a bill to place binding twine on the free list;
(4) a bill to reduce and ultimately to abolish the duty on tin
and terne plates; and (5) to reduced the duty on lead ores.
These bills were all passed by the House after thorough discussion;
as good material as the party could have for the presidential
campaign which was on the country before the “pop-gun”
bills, as the Republicans called them, were out of the way.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the face of an almost certain victory in the impending
election, serious Democrats began to ask themselves what,
after all, should they do? What did they mean by tariff
reform? To the majority there is no doubt that it meant
simply a combination of tariff for revenue and of moderate
protection of those industries already established, which it
was believed could not yet compete with foreign goods. They
professed to believe in free raw material—and did unless
the raw material happened to be a leading product of their
constituents. They were not generally in favor of drastic
cutting, but preferred it to gradual.</p>

<p class='c007'>This in the main was the position of Mr. Cleveland. It
certainly was a little more radical than some of Mr. Cleveland’s
advisors, Mr. Whitney and Mr. Vilas, for instance.
But it was a position which filled men like Colonel Mills and
Henry Watterson and Tom Johnson with disgust. They
determined that it was time that the party stopped its coquetting
with protection and followed a single-hearted tariff-for-revenue only
policy, and it was such a policy which Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>Watterson in particular determined should be adopted by the
Democratic convention. He had succeeded in getting a
tariff-for-revenue only plank into the platforms of 1876 and
1880. In 1884 he had seen his party, “with General Butler
astride its back and Mr. Randall on its flanks,” as he described
it, obliged to straddle. In 1888 this straddle had been
repeated. Mr. Cleveland, seeing a “condition and not a
theory,” could not sanction a plank which promised to reform
the tariff with revenue only in mind. He knew the effects of
duties on industries ought to and would be considered. Mr.
Watterson went to Cincinnati in 1892 prepared for the fight
of his life. He won. They called him a platform-smasher
afterwards; he corrected them: he was a platform-maker;
and that was true. Henry Watterson by his tactics and eloquence
led the Democratic convention of 1892 to declare for
tariff-for-revenue only, and Mr. Watterson meant just that.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How would I make a tariff bill?” he said, later, in one of
the most notable political speeches of the period.</p>

<p class='c012'>“By the aid of all the best experts and authorities I would get
together all the needful statistical data. I would then find a
clean sheet of paper. I would lay this on the table—not the little
round one, but the big oblong table—in the Ways and Means
Committee Room. Then I would open the cupboard containing,
among other perishable contents, the McKinley Bill. I would
take this out none too gently—and pitch it into the fire. Then
I would draw upon my clean piece of paper three lines. Thus:</p>

when I got $200,000,000 I would stop. Then I would take
another bit of white paper, and I would frame an Internal Revenue
Act, raising $175,000,000 on spirits and tobacco-making,
$375,000,000 in all—and the rest, $50,000,000 or $75,000,000,
as the estimate might require, I would raise by a tax, first on inheritance
and dividends, and then, if needs required, on big
incomes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then I would call the Committee—the Democratic members
of the Committee, I mean—and, when any one of them proposed
to confuse the simplicity of this perfectly plain Tariff-for-Revenue-only
Act by the old cant about the danger of being too precipitate
and extreme, I would knock him out—not down—by saying:
“Read the National Democratic Platform.””</p>

<p class='c006'>How far from this uncompromising sort of revision Mr.
Cleveland was, his letter of acceptance in 1892 shows:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tariff reform is still our purpose. Though we oppose the
theory that tariff laws may be passed having for their object the
granting of discriminating and unfair governmental aid to private
ventures, we wage no exterminating war against any American
interests. We believe a readjustment can be accomplished, in
accordance with the principles we profess, without disaster or
demolition. We believe that the advantages of freer raw material
should be accorded to our manufacturers, and we contemplate a
fair and careful distribution of necessary tariff burdens rather
than the precipitation of free trade.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We anticipate with calmness the misrepresentation of our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>motives and purposes, instigated by a selfishness which seeks to
hold in unrelenting grasp its unfair advantage under existing laws.
We will rely upon the intelligence of our fellow-countrymen to
reject the charge that a party comprising a majority of our people
is planning the destruction or injury of American interests; and
we know they cannot be frightened by the spectre of impossible
free trade.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Cleveland was inaugurated in March of 1893, but tariff
reform was not the first work before him. The Silver Question
was the more pressing, and the extra session he called for
August had as its business the repeal of the purchasing clause
of the Silver Bill which the Republicans had adopted in 1890,
and by which they had bought a part of the votes for the
McKinley Bill. The extra time of this session was utilized
to begin work on the tariff. More loudly than ever the public
demanded its reform. Nothing that had been promised that
the McKinley Bill would do had been done, nothing but reducing
the surplus—and that had been overdone. The combination
of free sugar, prohibitive tariffs, and reckless spending
with purchasing bonds not yet due at a premium, had
reduced it to over $105,000,000 in the year the bill was
adopted, to $2,500,000 in the year Mr. Cleveland was elected
and a deficit was ahead; in fact, Mr. Cleveland inherited a
deficit which the fiscal year after his inauguration had reached
nearly $70,000,000. He also had inherited a business depression,
the culmination of which came in the first summer of his
administration, and along with the deficit and panic a series
of labor troubles equal to those of the ’80’s. The McKinley
Bill had failed utterly to do the two things which its makers
had oftenest declared it would do, preserve prosperity and
satisfy labor. Steadily after its passage depression grew. In
1892 the labor troubles of our country were as acute as in any
year of our history, and these troubles were in the highly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>protected industries, in iron, steel, wool, and cotton. The
McKinley Bill was not the cause of the depression, as the
Democrats argued. The world was in panic. One of those
periodic disturbances which sweeps the globe, a logical result
of man’s bungling with the laws of trade, had started.
That we did not feel the acute pangs of this disturbance as
soon as Europe was due to the stimulants we had been taking
in the way of high tariffs and cheap money. When they wore
off, as they quickly did, our condition was the worse for the
delay. A few months after Mr. Cleveland’s election the depression
and unrest culminated in the panic of ’93. There
has always been an effort to shift the responsibility of this
disturbance on the Democrats. The panic of ’93 was caused,
so Republican orators have repeated for eighteen years, by
alarm at the prospect of a Democratic revision of the tariff.
There was never a serious charge with less foundation. That
panic was headed directly towards us long before Mr. Cleveland’s
nomination. A McKinley bill could not stop it; but it
did make it the more acute when it came, by the very fact
that it had helped free silver to hold it back.</p>

<p class='c007'>By utilizing the extra session, the Ways and Means Committee
had a bill ready for the regular session which began
in December, 1893. The chairman now at the head of the
Committee was James Lyne Wilson of West Virginia. His
appointment to succeed Mr. Springer, who had engineered the
“pop-gun” bills, had been particularly satisfactory to the
tariff-for-revenue only Democrats. Mr. Wilson was a man of
fifty, an educated gentleman, who had been, in turn, a Confederate
soldier, a practising lawyer, and a college president.
Through it all he had kept alive a disposition to politics.
He had written and spoken on whatever public question was
uppermost. He had attended conventions, and served as a
delegate, a “scholar in politics.” Finally, this interest and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>activity took him to Congress, where his sound economic ideas
and his skill in presenting them had recommended him to the
best element in his party, Cleveland, Carlisle, and Mills. In
1884 he aided Carlisle in his fight against the Randall faction.
In 1888 he was put on the Ways and Means Committee, where
he served Mr. Mills excellently. It has been customary to
speak of Mr. Wilson as impractical and academic, but the
bill he brought in in December, 1893, far from being a schoolmaster’s
application of his own theories, was distinctly
practical. The bill was not what he had hoped to make it.
Mr. Wilson said in his report: “With the tariff, as with every
other long-standing abuse that has interwoven itself with our
social and industrial system, the legislator must always remember
that in the beginning temperate reform is safest,
having in itself the principle of growth.” The first step he
had had in mind was to take taxes from the materials of industry.
In Mr. Wilson’s judgment it was the higher cost of raw
materials rather than higher wages which hampered American
manufacturers. Therefore the Wilson Bill made wool, coal,
iron-ore, hemp, and flax free. To “help the farmers” duties
were taken from agricultural machinery, from cotton bagging,
from salt, and from binding twine. An effort was made to do
away with all specific duties. On manufactured goods there
was no severe reduction: from one-third to one-half on window
glass; 25 per cent on steel rails; lower rates on what Mr.
Wilson called the “bogus industry” of making American tin
plate; one-fourth cent per pound on refined sugar instead of
one-half.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bill was a grave disappointment to the tariff-for-revenue only
Democrats. It did not go far enough, complained
Mr. Mills in an article in the <cite>North American Review</cite>
for February, 1894. It was only “a Sabbath Day’s journey
on the way to reform.” He would have put every item in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>the chemical schedule on the free list. He would not only
have made ores free, but pigs, bars, bloomers, slabs, ingots,
sheets, and plates, that is, all materials which had been advanced
to a first or second stage towards manufacture. On
the same principle he would have made not only wool and
hemp free, but yarns and fibres. Mr. Mills was particularly
disturbed because Mr. Wilson had not equalized the import
duty and the internal taxes on beer, whiskey, and tobacco.
He believed these three should bear the brunt of taxation.
As it was then, the internal tax was low and the duties very
high. The brewers, distillers, and cigar-makers paid low
taxes, and, cut off from foreign competition by high duties,
kept up prices. Colonel Mills reckoned that under the
McKinley Bill the duty on imported cigars amounted to
$70.44 a thousand, the internal tax was $3.00 per thousand.
He wished to make each $6.00. This would give revenue
and cheaper cigars at once. At the same time it would check
the tendency to combine.</p>

<p class='c007'>A more severe critic than Colonel Mills was Mr. Watterson.
In a speech in Louisville in January, he said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have read with exceeding care and great concern, the reports
accompanying the newly-introduced measure, of Tariff revision.
The Democratic report begins by a masterly declaration of Tariff-for-revenue only
logic, to end in an actual exposition of Protectionist
practice. For the Chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee I entertain the very greatest respect. He is an able,
conscientious, patriotic Democrat. He has encountered difficulties
and made sacrifices, and endured disappointments, which
should earn him the sympathy, rather than the criticism, of his
party associates. But, with submission, I think he has been
forced by pressure, and not by his own consent, to bring in a
measure that strikes a blow at the cause of genuine Tariff
Reform, and may set the policy of revenue only back for many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>years to come. It is far, very far, from a measure that can be
truthfully described as embodying the idea of ‘a Tariff-for-revenue only.’
It is merely better than the McKinley Bill in
degree, not in kind, and if Protectionism is ever to be dislodged,
I doubt the Trojan-horse stratagem to which it seems to incline.
We live in the age of Carnegies and Goulds, not in that of Priam
and Æneas.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But the bill Mr. Wilson reported was better from a Democratic
point of view than the one sent to the Senate early in
February. The chief difficulty encountered in the passage
through the House he hinted at in an anecdote he told just
before the bill was voted on.</p>

<p class='c012'>“When Sir Robert Peel was just entering upon his work of tariff
reform in England,” said Mr. Wilson, “he read to the House of
Commons a letter that had been sent him by a canny Scotch fisherman.
The writer protested against lowering the duty on herrings,
for fear, as he said, that the Norwegian fisherman might undersell
him; but he assured Sir Robert, in closing the letter, that in every
respect except herrings he was a thoroughgoing free-trader. I
trust that no Democrat to-day will be thinking more about his
herrings than the cause of the people.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was not the “herrings” which had found their way into
the bill, however, which caused the largest number of Democrats
to hesitate over it. They were all accustomed to them.
It was a greater innovation, an amendment providing for a
tax on all incomes of over $4000. Mr. Wilson had not
approved of it, he had believed it inexpedient; but when the
committee decided otherwise, he threw in his fortunes loyally
with them. “I have never been hostile to the idea of an
income tax,” he said. “It has been opposed here as class
legislation; it is nothing of the kind, Mr. Speaker; it is
simply an effort, an honest first effort, to balance the weight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>of taxation on the poor consumers of the country who have
heretofore borne it all. Gentlemen who complain of it as
class legislation forget that during the fifty years of its
existence in England it has been the strongest force in preventing
or allaying those class distinctions that have harassed
the governments of the Old World.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The bill was passed, “herrings,” income tax, and all, on
February 1, 1894, and was at once sent to the Senate. So
sharp had the criticism of the bill been that the Democratic
caucus appointed a sub-committee of three to go over it and
make a more representative Democratic measure, before it
should be reported. This committee was made up of Jones
of Arkansas, Vest of Missouri, and Mills of Texas. Colonel
Mills had been elected to the Senate the fall before. Although
not a member of the Finance Committee, he was placed on the
sub-committee. After three weeks’ hard and incessant work,
the bill was reported to the Democratic caucus, and here a
strong opposition at once developed, an opposition so obstinate
that it was obvious it would defeat the bill if it could
not be satisfied. The leaders of this faction were Senators
Arthur P. Gorman of Maryland and Calvin S. Brice of Ohio.
These gentlemen had organized so solidly a small number of
their party colleagues, dissatisfied with the reductions the
bill made on articles in which they were interested, that they
were able to say to the Committee that unless their demands
were satisfied no bill should pass. A look at the make-up
of the Senate shows how easily they could carry out their
threat. There were in the body thirty-eight Republicans,
forty-four Democrats, and four Populists, the latter voting
on the tariff with the Democrats. Five votes diverted from
the forty-four would, if the Republicans voted solidly, as they
were expected to do, give a majority of one against the bill.
Messrs. Gorman and Brice could show the five votes. One of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>these was that of David J. Hill of New York, who had given
notice that he would in no case support a measure carrying
an income tax. The result of this alignment was that the
bill was revised under the direction of Senators Gorman and
Brice and reported to the Senate with some 634 amendments.</p>

<p class='c007'>As an illustration of the kind of reconstruction which went
on, take the sugar schedule. It is an illuminating example of
tariff-making as practised by the Senate of the United States,
both then and now. We have seen what the McKinley Bill
did for raw sugar,—made it free, but gave bounties to the
home sugar-growers equivalent to two cents a pound. As for
refined sugar, all grades from No. 16, Dutch Standard, upward,
were allowed one-half cent a pound, which was undoubtedly
a pure gratuity to the sugar trust. Formed in
1887, with a capital of $50,000,000, the stock of this organization
had not been listed on the New York stock exchange
until February of 1889. When the McKinley Bill was first
brought into the House in January of 1890, sugar certificates
were worth fifty cents on the dollar. Their rise between that
date, when it looked as if refined sugar would be given no duty,
and the date in May, when the one-half cent was fixed, was
told three years later on the witness stand by a Senator of
the United States who was familiar with operations of this
sort, Calvin S. Brice of Ohio:</p>

<p class='c012'>“During the month of January,” said Mr. Brice, “sugar stock
fluctuated between 50 and 60, with as wide or wider fluctuations
in each of the four following months. So then when the bill had
passed the House of Representatives and had been favorably
considered and settled in the Senate Finance Committee in May,
the sugar trust certificates had advanced to 95, an advance
of 45 points or $22,500,000 computed on the capital of the sugar
trust, or $33,750,000 if the other $25,000,000 which were added
a few months afterwards as representing the Spreckels, Harrison,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>and Knight refineries are taken into account. During the fall
of 1890 the Baring panic temporarily depressed sugar trust certificates,
as well as other securities in the New York Stock Exchange,
but as soon as that had gone by, the sugar trust certificates went
above par, and eventually under the operations of the McKinley
Act reached 134 or 135; an advance from January, 1890, when
the McKinley Bill was introduced, of 85 points, or $42,500,000 on
the sugar trust certificates, and an advance of $63,750,000 on the
American Sugar Refining Company’s Stock, the Company which
in 1891 succeeded the original trust.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The dealings in the certificates on the New York Stock
Exchange in 1890 Senator Brice declared to have amounted
to 8,000,000 shares, $800,000,000. As for profits, the trust’s
president, Mr. H. O. Havemeyer, said on the witness stand
in 1894 that he reckoned them at close to $25,000,000 for the
three years, or, as he put it, “three-eighths of a cent more
on every pound they (the consumers) ate.” Without the
McKinley Bill this would have been impossible, and, said Mr.
Havemeyer, “as long as the McKinley Bill is there we will
exact that profit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This episode had scandalized the country and intensified
the disgust with the sugar refiners which their open swindling
in the preceding fifteen years had aroused. When the Democrats
in the House came to make their bill they at first proposed
a duty of one-fourth cent a pound on refined sugar,
half of what McKinley had given. This was undoubtedly
one-fourth of a cent too much. With free raw sugar the
refiners could carry on their business at a profit. This was
demonstrated to Mr. Wilson’s satisfaction while the bill was
still in the House, and when it left, refined sugar as well as
raw was free.</p>

<p class='c007'>As said above, the bill was referred to a sub-committee of
which Colonel Roger Q. Mills was a member. Now Mr. Mills,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>like most tariff-for-revenue only Democrats, had always
held that a tax on raw sugar was one of the least obnoxious
that could be placed. It yielded a large and steady revenue.
It was true that it was a tax falling more heavily on the poor
than on the rich, but unhappily most taxes are unjust in
this respect. Holding this opinion, and believing that the
bill did not provide sufficient revenue, Mr. Mills, as he later
related, said to his colleagues:</p>

<p class='c012'>“We have got to have more money than the Wilson Bill makes,
and we have to have a duty on sugar. I do not want it. I do
not like to go backwards. I would not have taken sugar off the
dutiable list and put it on the free list. It has been done, and I
do not like to put anything back on the dutiable list, but we have
got to do it, and you may as well make up your minds about it.
We have to have more money.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Senators Vest and Jones held out for several days against
him, but finally they reluctantly agreed to a duty on raw
sugar. On refined they proposed only enough to make up to
the refiners for the extra cost of their raw material—that is, a
compensatory, not a protective, duty.</p>

<p class='c007'>But this plan never reached the public. The House bill
had aroused the Sugar Trust to wrath, and all through the
winter and spring of 1894 one or more of its chief officers
was in Washington, besieging the Senate and the Administration.
Mr. H. O. Havemeyer, the president, Theodore
Havemeyer, the vice-president, and John O. Searles,
secretary and treasurer, armed with samples and statistics
and proofs of political influence, urged upon a worried and
reluctant committee a scheme of duties which would give
them at least as large a benefit as they had under the McKinley
Bill. The gentlemen seem to have been able to secure
the attention of all the Senators whom they thought it worth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>while to approach, excepting Senator Mills. Mr. Havemeyer
made repeated efforts to get to him, but always failed. Finally
he asked Secretary Carlisle to give him a note of introduction.
He knew Senator Mills, he told the secretary, but he was a
busy man and peculiar, and it was difficult to see him. Mr.
Carlisle gave the note, and one evening Mr. Havemeyer
presented it at the Senator’s door with his own card and that
of Mr. J. R. Rickey, the inventer of the famous “gin-Rickey.”
Was the Senator in, and would he see them? The answer
came back. “Senator Mills is in, but he will <i>not</i> see the
gentlemen.” Nor did Mr. Havemeyer ever succeed in
presenting his ideas of a sugar schedule to Senator Mills.</p>

<p class='c007'>The activities of the sugar people caused all sorts of rumors
to run rife through the press, and finally when the bill was
reported on the 20th of March providing a rate of about one
cent a pound on raw sugar with an additional one-eighth of
a cent per pound on refined, there was an immediate outcry.
When later further changes were made in the schedule, making
it more intricate and more advantageous to the refiners,
dissatisfaction grew. “It would have been quite as appropriate
and edifying,” said the <cite>Nation</cite>, “and quite as good
policy, to have enacted that the Standard Oil Trust should
receive $30,000,000 out of the public treasury during the next
six months as a reward of merit, and two and one-eighth
cents per gallon for all the oil they might hereafter sell in this
country, as to do what is done for the sugar trust.” The
ugliest rumors were afloat, talk of bribes, deals, and threats.
They finally culminated in an article published in the <cite>Philadelphia
Press</cite> and signed “Holland” (E. J. Edwards), in which
in a most circumstantial way the author declared that $500,000
had been contributed to the Democratic campaign fund by
the Sugar Trust. In return pledges had been given that the
Trust would be taken care of. When the House removed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>the duty, the Trust had reminded the Administration of its
pledges. Mr. Carlisle, by Mr. Cleveland’s directions, had
appeared before the sub-committee and had told them that
the party was bound to satisfy the sugar interests. There
were detailed descriptions of interviews between sugar men
and Senators, and of directions sent from the White House.
One of the shameful features of the story was that a number
of Senators had taken advantage of secret information on the
sugar schedule to speculate in sugar stock. This amazing
story of political barter would have raised a chorus of jeers,
had there not been before the country’s eye so much corroborating
evidence. The clamor was so loud over the article
that in May an investigation was made. Many of the details
of the story were discredited. Mr. Cleveland, Mr.
Carlisle, and Mr. Mills were certainly cleared, but a substantial
scandal remained. By the frank admission of Mr. Havemeyer,
it was proved that the trust was in the habit of making
contributions to both parties, that is, each party got something,
if the result was doubtful. If not, the contribution
went to the dominant side, that being the one to which the
trust would look for favors. This conclusion is clinched by
the following bit of a dialogue which occurred in the course
of the investigation:</p>

<p class='c012'>“<i>Mr. Havemeyer.</i>—The American Sugar Refining Company
has no politics of any kind.</p>

<p class='c014'>“<i>Senator Allen.</i>—Only the politics of business?</p>

<p class='c014'>“<i>Mr. Havemeyer.</i>—Only the politics of business.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Whatever the Democrats received in 1892 from the Sugar
Trust,—and it is probably as certain that they received, not
$500,000, but a good sum, as it is certain that Mr. Quay
received something like $100,000 from the same source in the
campaign of 1888,—it was the sugar refiners who succeeded in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>getting the rates they wanted into the Wilson Bill, not the
sugar-producers. So strong was their position with the faction
remodelling the bill, that is, with Mr. Gorman and
Mr. Brice, that they were able to overpower even the
Louisiana Senators, on whom the victory of the insurgents
was supposed to depend, and to replace the specific duty
which these interests wanted and which raw sugar long
had had, by an ad valorem rate, a form which was believed
to work and probably did work decidedly to the advantage
of the trust.</p>

<p class='c007'>The charge in the <cite>Press</cite> article that many Senators had
speculated in sugar stock, was investigated. Men like
Cushman K. Davis, George Gray, George F. Hoar, Roger Q.
Mills, John M. Palmer, John Sherman, and John P. Morgan
had to suffer along with Quay and Brice, Smith of New Jersey
and Murphy of New York, the humiliation of an examination.
Senators McPherson and Quay acknowledged that
they had been dealing in sugar while the schedule was in the
Senate. In no other cases was the fact established, but the
suspicion remained in spite of denials that other Senators
were equally guilty. This popular belief was more strongly
entrenched around Senator Aldrich than any other member
of the body. He had been the chief advocate of the refiners
in the Senate for a number of years. He was a friend of
John O. Searles, and the two had been much together while
the schedule of 1894 was making. His fortunes apparently
expanded rapidly about this time. The suspicion crystallized
in a nickname for his country home which still clings to it,—“the
sugar house,”—but there was never a vestige of proof,
so far as the author knows, that sugar had anything to do with
Senator Aldrich’s fortune.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course, it would have been impossible for the sugar
Senators to have received the favors they did if they had not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>acquiesced in similar gifts to other interests. They paid for
their advantages by consenting to a duty on iron-ore, on silverore
containing lead, and on coal, all of which should have been
free under Democratic doctrine. They paid by consenting
to scores of increased duties on manufactured articles, which
in some cases raised rates to the McKinley level. A typical
transaction was the duty on collars and cuffs. It had been
cut by the House. Senator Murphy of New York wanted
it raised to oblige certain constituents. He threatened to
vote against the bill if he was denied. He, of course, got
what he wanted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nor was it the Democrats alone who raided the Wilson
Bill. The revolt of Senators Gorman and Brice was an invitation
to the Republicans to see what they could do for their
constituents. When the news of what was going on spread
through the country, Washington rapidly filled up with the
agents and counsel of the protected industries, and under
the leadership of Senator Quay a campaign of obstruction
was carried on. Unless you give us what we ask, you shall
have no bill at all, said Senator Quay; I will talk it to death.
He began to execute his threat on April 14, and ended on
June 16. Day after day, the <cite>Congressional Record</cite> states laconically,
“Senator Quay resumed the floor in continuance of
the speech begun on the 14th of April,” and occasionally it
adds, “speech will be printed when finished.” Senator Quay
occupied twelve days of the period in his filibustering. He
ceased because he had assurance that the duties he sought
would be granted. His speech covers some 235 pages of the
<cite>Congressional Record</cite>, an exhibit of legislation by violence
which happily has few parallels in our history. James M.
Swank, the manager of the Iron and Steel Association, says
that Senator Quay secured higher rates of duties in “hundreds”
of cases by his filibuster. He and Senator Aldrich seem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>to have turned their advantage mainly to saving their own
chief industries,—iron and steel and cotton,—for both
schedules were written by the manufacturers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chief industry which did not get about what it wanted
was wool. The House had provided for free wool and a
35 per cent duty on all manufactured goods. This was 5 per
cent less than Mr. Mills had proposed to put on woollens in
1888. Of course the Republicans prophesied the most
terrible disasters from this change. The industry had been
sharing in the general depression of the country, that is, the
McKinley Bill had not been able to make it prosperous.
The National Association of Wool Manufacturers, confronted
by this fact, pleaded that the bill be given a longer test.
They declared that there was a “universal agreement between
manufacturers” that the “tariff was now scientifically adjusted.”
Nobody was going to suffer from the rates, they
said, and in time they would insure permanent prosperity.
The Association, of course, overlooked the fact that the rates
they were then enjoying had, with only slight decreases in
1883, been in force since 1867, and that they had not prevented
periodical depressions. They overlooked the fact,
too, that, far from being united, as they declared, a very large
body of the ablest woollen manufacturers in the country were
at that moment petitioning for free wool and advising lower
duties on their own products. All of this had little effect on
the Democrats. The schedule went to the Senate as it had
been prepared by Mr. Wilson’s committee; and when the sub-committee
took hold of it, the duty on woollens was made
30 per cent instead of 35 per cent. This schedule was reported
to the Senate on March 20, and soon after that the wool-growers
and wool manufacturers learned of the Democratic
insurgent movement for higher duties led by Gorman and
Brice.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>“As soon as it became known that all the schedules were being
written up to or towards protective rates,” one of their leading
historians wrote afterwards in the Bulletin of the Association, “the
woollen manufacturers began to gather in Washington with a view
to discovering what could be done to save their own industry from
destruction. The first efforts to this end were directed towards
securing compound duties. Many variations in the compound
rates originally suggested were made, finally resulting in a schedule
in which all manufacturers acquiesced.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The compound schedule was thrown out of court almost immediately,
coupled with the information that under no circumstances
would the suggestion of compound duties on woollen goods be
considered. If at this juncture the woollen manufacturers had
been so fortunate as to possess among the Democratic Senators
a single friend, so earnestly and honestly their friend as to do for
them what certain Senators did for certain other industries (notably
several branches of the iron and steel industry), this compound
schedule could have been forced into the bill, as other
specific duties were forced into it everywhere else, as the condition
precedent to its passage. But they had no such friend, none at
least who was willing to go as far as other Senators went for other
industries. Thus it happens that the wool schedule is almost the
only one in the Senate bill which was not dictated by some one
powerful enough to make its terms fairly satisfactory to the industries
concerned.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The Wilson Bill was returned to the House Committee
with 634 amendments attached. The Committee refused to
accept the amendments and a conference was arranged.
Nothing came of this. The Senate conferrees held to the
amendments, the House conferrees to disagreement. In
reporting the disagreement to the House, Mr. Wilson read a
letter from President Cleveland protesting against the bill.
It voiced his pain and disgust at the outcome of the long
fight he had led and counselled resistance to the miserable
compromises which filled the bill:</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>“My public life has been so closely related to the subject”
(tariff reform), Mr. Cleveland wrote, “I have so longed for its
accomplishment, and I have so often promised its realization to
my fellow-countrymen as a result of their trust and confidence in
the Democratic party, that I hope no excuse is necessary for my
earnest appeal to you that in this crisis you strenuously insist upon
party honesty and good faith and a sturdy adherence to Democratic
principles.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I believe these are absolutely necessary conditions to the continuation
of Democratic existence.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I cannot rid myself of the feeling that this conference will
present the best, if not the only, hope of true Democracy. Indications
point to its action as the reliance of those who desire the
genuine fruition of Democratic effort, the fulfilment of Democratic
pledges, and the redemption of Democratic promises to the people.
To reconcile differences in the details comprised within the fixed
and well-defined lines of principle will not be the sole task of the
conference, but as it seems to me its members will also have in
charge the question whether Democratic principles themselves are
to be saved or abandoned.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There is no excuse for mistaking or misapprehending the feeling
and temper of the rank and file of the Democracy. They are
downcast under the assertion that their party fails in ability to
manage the government, and they are apprehensive that efforts
to bring about tariff reform may fail; but they are much more
downcast and apprehensive in their fear that Democratic principles
may be surrendered. In these circumstances they cannot
do otherwise than to look with confidence to you and those who
with you have patriotically and sincerely championed the cause of
tariff reform within Democratic lines and guided by Democratic
principles. This confidence is vastly augmented by the action
under your leadership of the House of Representatives upon the
bill now pending.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Every true Democrat and every sincere tariff reformer knows
that this bill in its present form and as it will be submitted to the
conference falls far short of the consummation for which we have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>long labored, for which we have suffered defeat without discouragement,
which in its anticipation gave us a rallying cry in our day of
triumph, and which in its promise of accomplishment is so interwoven
with Democratic pledges and Democratic success, that our
abandonment of the cause or the principles upon which it rests
means party perfidy and party dishonor.</p>

<p class='c014'>“One topic will be submitted to the conference which embodies
Democratic principle so directly that it cannot be compromised.
We have in our platforms and in every way possible declared in
favor of the free importation of raw materials. We have again
and again promised that this should be accorded to our people
and our manufacturers as soon as the Democratic party was
invested with the power to determine the tariff policy of the
country.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The party now has that power. We are as certain to-day as
we have ever been of the great benefit that would accrue to the
country from the inauguration of this policy, and nothing has
occurred to release us from our obligation to secure this advantage
to our people. It must be admitted that no tariff measure can
accord with Democratic principles and promises or bear a genuine
Democratic badge that does not provide for free raw materials.
In these circumstances, it may well excite our wonder that Democrats
are willing to depart from this, the most Democratic of all
tariff principles, and that the inconsistent absurdity of such a
proposed departure should be emphasized by the suggestion that
the wool of the farmer be put on the free fist and the protection
of tariff taxation be placed around the iron-ore and coal of corporations
and capitalists.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How can we face the people after indulging in such outrageous
discriminations and violations of principles?</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is quite apparent that this question of free raw materials
does not admit of adjustment on any middle ground, since their
subjection to any rate of tariff taxation, great or small, is alike
violative of Democratic principle and Democratic good faith.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I hope you will not consider it intrusive if I say something in
relation to another subject which can hardly fail to be troublesome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>to the conference. I refer to the adjustment of tariff taxation on
sugar. Under our party platform and in accordance with our declared
party purposes, sugar is a legitimate and logical article of
revenue taxation. Unfortunately, however, incidents have accompanied
certain stages of the legislation which will be submitted
to the conference, that have aroused in connection with this subject
a national Democratic animosity to the methods and manipulations
of trusts and combinations.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I confess to sharing in this feeling, and yet it seems to me we
ought, if possible, to sufficiently free ourselves from prejudice to
enable us coolly to weigh the considerations which in formulating
tariff legislation ought to guide our treatment of sugar as a taxable
article. While no tenderness should be entertained for trusts,
and while I am decidedly opposed to granting them, under the
guise of tariff taxation, any opportunity to further their peculiar
methods, I suggest that we ought not to be driven away from the
Democratic principle and policy which lead to the taxation of
sugar by the fear, quite likely exaggerated, that in carrying out
this principle and policy, we may indirectly and inordinately
encourage a combination of sugar refining interests. I know that
in present conditions this is a delicate subject, and I appreciate
the depth and strength of the feeling which its treatment has
aroused.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I do not believe that we should do evil that good may come,
but it seems to me that we should not forget that our aim is the
completion of a tariff bill, and that in taxing sugar for proper purposes
and within reasonable bounds, whatever else may be said of
our action, we are in no danger of running counter to Democratic
principle. With all there is at stake, there must be in the treatment
of this article some ground upon which we are all willing to
stand, where toleration and conciliation may be allowed to solve
the problem without demanding the entire surrender of fixed and
conscientious convictions.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was on July 19th that Mr. Wilson read this letter to the
House. Following it a bitter attack was made upon Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>Cleveland by Mr. Gorman and others in the Senate. They
declared they had kept the President fully informed of the
changes which were being made in the bill; that they had
told him that it would be impossible to pass a bill which did
not embody them. Mr. Cleveland had insisted that a bill
must be passed, and he had urged them to go ahead and do
the best they could. This is no doubt true. But no one who
knew Grover Cleveland can accept their contention that he
had practically assured them that he would accept any bill
that they could pass. It was not like him to make such a
promise, nor was he a man to mislead. Moreover, Mr.
Cleveland would have been false to his own great sense of
responsibility if, for the sake of party, he had let the repudiation
of principle, and the juggling and trading the bill represented,
go without public reproof. There was a chance, too,
that his remonstrance might force from the Senate certain concessions,
such as the free iron-ore and coal which he so much
wanted. Mr. Cleveland took the chance. His letter failed
to do what its author sought. Indeed, it made the dominant
faction in the Senate so angry that it flatly refused to recede
from any of the amendments to which the House had declined
to assent. The upshot of the matter was that on August
13th the House gave in. Mr. Wilson’s brief closing remarks
show his disappointment. Until the last he had hoped and
believed, he said, that some form of honorable compromise
would be achieved. “But,” said he, “we have simply realized
in this great fight the fact so well stated by the great leader of
the tariff reform fight in Great Britain—that when the people
have gained a victory at the polls they must have a further
stand-up and knock-down fight with their own representatives.
And we have realized if nothing else the warning
lesson of the intrenchment of the protective tariff in this
country under thirty years of class legislation until the mere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>matter of tariff schedules is a matter of insignificance and the
great question presents itself,—is this to be a government by a
self-taxing people or a Government of taxation by trust and
monopolies? The question is now, whether this is a government
by the American people for the American people, or a
government of the sugar trust for the benefit of the sugar
trust.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But he advised voting for the bill. It was with most of
its rates as it was with the sugar duty.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Vicious as it may be, burdensome to the people as it may be,
favorable to the trust as it may be, it is less vicious, less favorable
to the trust, less burdensome to the people than is the McKinley
law, under which this trust (sugar) has grown so great as to overshadow
with its power the American people.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Never had an opposition a more substantial reason for
taunting a majority than had the Republicans when it was
finally seen that the Senate had won. Mr. Reed had been
spokesman for the Republicans throughout the making of
the bill and he had used his power in as sheerly and consistently
brutal a fashion as is to be found in the records of
Congress. But what he now said had a ring of honest indignation
and it was entirely justified by the facts.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The adoption of the Senate bill,” said Mr. Reed, “is a complete
abandonment of the fundamental principles of tariff reform.
The Senate bill has been constructed upon entirely different lines.
It was framed upon the broad bedrock foundation of the necessity
of securing 43 votes, and all minor considerations had to give
way to this great underlying principle.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Coal is taxed in order to secure the necessary votes of the selfstyled
ambassador from the sovereign state of Maryland; protection
is accorded to the industries of the state of Maryland as
the price of her votes; seventy-five millions of people are to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>burdened with a tax on sugar in order to hold the votes of the sugar-producing
state of Louisiana, and the sugar trust had to have its
demands satisfied in order to insure liberal contributions to the
Democratic campaign fund; while Republican Senators had but
to threaten interminable debate to secure full protection to the
industries of their state.</p>

<p class='c014'>“In this way the Gorman Bill was constructed and passed, and
it is this measure, so framed, you now propose without amendment
or debate to indorse and approve. How you are able to do this
with any sense of self-respect, it is difficult to understand. You
voted for the Wilson Bill under protest, declaring you did so because,
it was a movement in the right direction, a step towards free trade;
and now you accept the Gorman Bill without regard to the principles
upon which it was constructed and without knowing whether
it leads towards protection or free trade in the face of an acknowledged
abandonment of all principle. Such unexampled party
stultification cannot be too severely condemned.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What will be the fate of this bill at the other end of the avenue,
it is impossible to forecast, but the President of the United States
will belie his reputation for courage and tenacity of purpose if he
does not promptly stamp it with his veto.</p>

<p class='c014'>“When this bill is laid before the President for Executive
approval and he has sufficiently examined it to be assured of its
identity as the very measure which he himself has already publicly
repudiated, I can imagine him taking the Wilson letter in one
hand and reading his own words, ‘This is an act of party perfidy
and party dishonor,’ and then dropping his pen from the other,
exclaiming with ineffable scorn, ‘Is thy servant a dog that he
should do this thing?’”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Reed was right. The bill, which was passed by a vote
of 182 to 106, 12 Democrats only voting against it, was never
signed by Grover Cleveland. It became a law without his
name on August 27, 1894.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER X<br /> <span class='large'>THE DINGLEY BILL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Two months after the Wilson Bill became a law, the Democratic
majority in the House of Representatives suffered as
thorough a reverse as had the Republicans in 1892. The
House stood, after the election, 246 Republicans, 104 Democrats,
and 7 Populists. The South returned 33 Republicans.
The painful failure of Congress to make the honest and
thorough revision of the tariff which the country had expected
was certainly one cause of the party’s overthrow. Honorable
men could not sanction the scandal and barter which had
attended the making of the new law. But there were other
and powerful causes for the defeat. There was the silver
question. With every month it became more certain that
silver was to be the issue in the next campaign. There was
a possibility at least that the Republicans would continue to
make the issue their own. The group of Western Republican
Senators who in 1890 had voted for a tariff bill of which they
did not approve in order to get votes for a silver bill of which
the voters did not approve, were more hotly devoted to free
silver than ever,—more determined to make it a party measure.
Already several Republican State Conventions had
declared for it. Among the New England Congressmen
there seems to have been a willingness to prepare the way
for some kind of action, at least to consider free silver, for
in the spring of 1894 Henry Cabot Lodge made a conciliatory
and ambiguous speech on the subject in the Senate and there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>were others, who like him seemed to be ready to go either way.
On the other hand, free silver had no hope with the then
dominant faction of the Democratic party. Mr. Cleveland
and his supporters were willing to go down to defeat rather
than even seem to encourage the fallacy. Free silver then
carried many voters to the Republicans in the fall of 1894.</p>

<p class='c007'>The strongest reason for the overthrow was the least sound.
It was an unreasoning revolt against the party because of the
panic of 1893 and the long period of hard times which had
followed it. The panic happened after Mr. Cleveland was
nominated, and therefore his election and his policy caused it!
The public overlooked entirely the fact that hard times,
failures, falling prices, and labor troubles had begun soon after
the passing of the McKinley Bill and had steadily become
graver with every month of its life. Between 1890 and 1894,
the period the McKinley Bill was in force, Ohio-scoured wool
fell from 71½ cents to 44½ cents, a drop of 27 cents. In
1896, under the Wilson Bill, wool began to revive. Bessamer
pig-iron fell off from $18.00 to $12.00 per ton between 1890 and
1894. These same tendencies were shown in nearly all prices
where the articles carried prohibitive tariffs. Almost, if not
quite as great a fall in prices occurred in 1890, 1891, 1892, and
1893 under the McKinley Bill, as after the Wilson Bill went
into effect and a lower duty had been added to the general
depression. The tariff considered the fall was greater under
the McKinley Bill on many important articles. Take steel
rails; under the McKinley Bill of 1890, they bore a duty of
$13.44 per ton. In 1890 they sold at an average price of
$31.77. In 1891 the price fell to $29.91; in 1893 to $28.12½.
The Wilson Bill reduced the duty on rails to $7.84. The
average price the first two years after the bill went into
operation was $24.00, and in the third year the price rose to
$28.00. The lowest price at which steel rails have ever been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>sold in this country was in the first year of the Dingley Bill,
$17.00 per ton. After the duty was put on barley for the
farmer by the McKinley Bill, the price went up for one year,
1891, but in 1892 it fell off 10 cents, and in 1893, 14 cents.
Free barley and the continued depression did little worse.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hides had no duty under either the McKinley or the Wilson
bills. The price began to fall in 1892, reached its lowest level
in 1894, and in 1895 rose higher than it had been in many
years. All woollen goods fell under the McKinley Bill and
began to recover in 1896. Measured by business failures and
labor troubles, the period of the McKinley tariff was as disastrous
as that of the Wilson. Indeed, there is quite as much
reason for laying the panic of 1893 to one bill as to the other,
but neither was responsible.</p>

<p class='c007'>The new Congress, which was elected in the fall of 1894,
first met in December, 1895. Mr. Reed was elected speaker
of the House and Nelson Dingley, also of Maine, was appointed
chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr.
Dingley was a man over sixty years old, a hard-working, conscientious,
experienced politician. He had been born and
educated in Maine. He had been one of the state’s best
newspaper editors and had filled, one after another, nearly
all her offices, that of governor included. In 1881 Mr.
Dingley was sent to Congress, where he had soon become
invaluable because of his extraordinary fund of information
on all sorts of subjects, particularly on all things relating to
American history and American industry. He held the
doctrine of protection in much the same pious regard as did
Mr. McKinley. For him it was a settled dogma—the only
question was the amount of a duty, and to the estimating of
that he brought an amazing patience in calculation and in
investigation. His colleague, Mr. Boutelle, once said that
he had for years lived in the same hotel with Mr. Dingley
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>and that he had never entered his room that he did not find
him surrounded by documents, a pad on his knee, laboriously
digesting them for his purposes. Facts alone stirred his mind.
No man was ever witty enough or wise enough to impress
Nelson Dingley, but no fact was too unimportant to receive
his attention. It is obvious that any tariff bill he directed
would be carefully made.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first business of the new Congress was to provide
revenue. Mr. Cleveland’s administration had inherited, as
already pointed out, a deficit of nearly $70,000,000. The
tariff bill which had been revised to increase the revenue had
failed. The sugar refiners, finding that a duty was to be
put on raw sugar, had brought in enormous quantities, free,
to hold for their needs. Thus, by their foresight, the treasury
in Mr. Cleveland’s first year was despoiled of revenues
it had a right to count on. Again, the income tax on which
they depended for a large sum was declared unconstitutional.
Something had to be done to bring in more money. The Republicans
had decided to use their power to put back the tariff
on wool and to increase that on a variety of manufactured
articles, and on December 26, 1895, Mr. Dingley reported a
bill providing for these increases. The bill was passed at
once by the House. Its fate in the Senate shows how thoroughly
the tariff had already been replaced by free silver.
The Finance Committee did not report it, but recommended
to the Senate that the needed revenue be raised not by the
House bill, but by the free coinage of silver; and pathetically
enough, poor Mr. Morrill, who for forty years had struggled
for sound money, was obliged, as chairman of the committee,
to report the measure.</p>

<p class='c007'>This putting of the tariff in second place was the more
evident as the time approached for the National Convention
of 1896. Silver was the question in which the real interest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>lay, not the tariff. Nevertheless, the wool-growers and woollen
manufacturers, the Iron and Steel Association, the high
protectionists everywhere, began, months before the Convention,
a determined campaign to commit the Republicans to
tariff revision as a leading issue, and to name William McKinley
for President. “Bill McKinley and the McKinley Bill”
seemed to them a slogan sufficient in itself to win an election.
They had their way. The platform declared protection to
be the “bulwark of American industrial independence and
the foundation of American development and prosperity.”
It also declared with evident reluctance its opposition to the
free coinage of silver except by international agreement with
the leading commercial nations of the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>The intention of the wool and the iron and steel interests
and their allies to force the tariff to the front in the campaign,
was frustrated at once by the extraordinary sweep to
silver in the Democratic Convention and the revolt to that
party of a large body of leading Republicans. If the election
was to be won at all, it had got to be won by an unequivocal
and whole-hearted stand for the gold standard and to that
Mr. McKinley was forced, half-silverite as he was, after a few
flat efforts to arouse enthusiasm for the bill of 1890. It
was McKinley and the gold standard, not Mr. McKinley and
prohibitive tariffs, which was opposed to Bryan and free
silver, and in 1896, Mr. McKinley won by the votes of the
Gold Democrats. It is probably true that many of them were
given to understand that the Republicans would let the tariff
alone or at least would not be in a hurry to revise it: at least
that claim was made by men of character and intelligence.
It was hardly Mark Hanna who could have made such a
promise. Mr. Hanna knew too well what his backers in iron
and steel and wool expected, and would demand for their
contributions. That these contributions were large, there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>can be no doubt. James M. Swank, the general manager
of the Iron and Steel Association, has said that more money
was spent to elect Mr. McKinley than had been spent to
elect Mr. Harrison, and certainly Mr. Swank was in a
position to know.</p>

<p class='c007'>At all events, the work to which Mr. McKinley called Congress
in extra session immediately after his inauguration, on
March 4, 1897, was not establishing sound money; it was
raising more revenue by duties “so levied upon foreign products
as to preserve the home market as far as possible to our
producers; to revive and increase manufacturers; to relieve
and encourage agriculture; to increase our domestic and
foreign commerce; to aid and develop mining and building;
and to render labor in every field of useful occupation the
liberal wages and adequate rewards to which skill and industry
are justly entitled.” Why Mr. McKinley expected a
new bill to do what his own had not been able to do, he did
not explain.</p>

<p class='c007'>The new bill was almost ready to report when the extra
session was called, for Mr. Dingley and his committee had
been at work all of the preceding winter preparing it. A
sincere effort was made to give a good bill according to Republican
lights. “We expect,” Mr. Dingley wrote Colonel
George C. Tichenor, who was assisting him, “to cut nearly all
our duties considerably below those of the act of 1890.” In
not a few cases, Mr. Dingley accepted the Wilson rates practically
as they stood. This was true of the metal and cotton
schedules. He felt safe in doing this, because, as he said,
they were “really made by the manufacturers.” Throughout
the schedules the committee aimed to replace the Wilson specifics
by ad valorems and, of course, this caused more or less
uncertainty as to whether or not by the change those rates
had not been raised more than the committee acknowledged.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>The Democrats charged that they had, but the fact seems to
be that Mr. Dingley sincerely aimed to keep duties nearer, if
possible, to the Wilson Bill than to the McKinley Bill.
The committee particularly desired to escape the charge of
fixing prohibitive duties. This had been done in 1894, professedly
to cut down the revenue, and the mischief it had
worked the party was not yet forgotten. In spite of the
repeated assurances of Mr. Dingley that the extremes of the
bill of 1890 were to be avoided, the committee did report
many rates as high and a few even higher; for instance, the
duties on flax and linen were advanced. A number of the
unimportant articles which the old bill had put on the free
list were put back in the dutiable list, as were nearly all the
important articles made free by the Wilson Bill,—wool, salt,
lumber, cotton bagging, cotton-ties, and burlaps.</p>

<p class='c007'>Works of art had been made free by the Democrats; the
Dingley Bill restored the duty. One reason given was that
“many objects having no artistic quality or merit whatever,
and calculated rather to corrupt than encourage art or culture”
were being imported! Foreign books, that is, “books
in language other than English,” over twenty years old,
engravings, etchings, music, maps, scientific books and
periodicals and supplies of all kinds for colleges, libraries,
galleries, and laboratories had been allowed to come in untaxed
by the Wilson Bill; all these duties were restored by
the Dingley Bill. Travellers were again subjected to the
irritation of having their luggage overhauled, and the amount
of purchases allowed them was reduced to $100.00. This
exasperating tax first appeared in the McKinley Bill; here the
limit fixed was $500.00. The Democrats dropped the clause
but it was now restored. But in spite of these mediæval
provisions, the Dingley Bill, when presented to the House on
March 19, 1897, was a fairly good protectionist measure,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>certainly a real improvement on the McKinley Bill. There
were fewer prohibitive rates, less contradiction, and less
quakery.</p>

<p class='c007'>In introducing the bill, the Republicans had laid down a
program for rushing it through the House by March 31, and
this was carried out, under protest, of course. The bill did
not come to the Senate from the Finance Committee until
May, and it came back with many changes. Mr. Aldrich, the
chairman of the committee, claimed that on the whole these
changes were downward. He was emphatic in his assertions
that moderate duties were expected by the country. It was
“thoroughly understood in the last political campaign,” said
Mr. Aldrich, “that if the Republican party should be again
intrusted with power, no extreme tariff legislation would
follow. It was believed, in the changed condition of the
country, a return to the duties imposed by the act of 1890
would not be necessary even from a protective standpoint.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Industrial conditions in this country, with very few exceptions,
do not demand a return to the rates imposed by the act
of 1890. The bitter contest which is going on among the leading
nations of the world for industrial supremacy has brought
about improvements in methods and economies in production
to an extent which was not thought possible a few years ago.
These new conditions must be taken into account in considering
the rates to be imposed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When the Finance Committee had believed the House rates
extreme, Mr. Aldrich said that they had lowered them. A
comparison of the bills shows that this was the fact in the
case of the chemical, the earthen ware, and the glass and
metal schedules. There were also reductions on certain
parts of the wool schedule. While the Senate amendments,
on the whole, aimed at lowering rates, they also aimed, like
the House bill, to protect everything which asked protection.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>The sugar schedule had undergone material changes and
mysterious ones. The rates on all but the lowest raw sugars
were higher than they were in the Dingley Bill, and there
was a gap between sugars of 87° and 88° polariscope test
much wider than between any other two grades. This exceptional
differential was effected by such indirection that
there was an immediate cry that Mr. Aldrich was trying to
play into the hands of the sugar trust. The schedule was
twice changed in the Senate, but when the bill came into
conference Mr. Dingley succeeded in having the House rates
restored.</p>

<p class='c007'>The political make-up in the Senate in 1897 was such that
it created for the Republicans a situation not unlike that of
the Democrats in 1894. Their Republican majority was considerable,
but there was a group of this majority interested
in free silver and not in the tariff, and it could not be counted
on. If they supported the bill, it would be in return for
concessions which they might ask. Almost at once it developed
that this group was going to use its power to raise the
duties on all grades of wool higher than the House or Senate
had proposed to do. Wool had been free under the Wilson
Bill. To cut a duty on an important product like wool 11
and 12 cents a pound without giving time for adjustment, of
course causes a severe strain on a business even in prosperous
times; to do it at a moment when all business is depressed
and when the particular product, as in the case of
wool in 1894, has been suffering ups and downs for many
years, is to increase the strain dangerously near the breaking
point. Free wool did intensify an existing distress but that
the sheep growers would not have rallied from it and adjusted
themselves in a very few years, no disinterested person can for
a moment believe. If they had been willing to do this, there
is no doubt that the business of wool-growing would be on a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>more solid basis to-day than it has ever been in this country.
It would be conducted according to those laws of supply and
demand which govern trade, and not be subjected, as it is
now, to periodical excitations and depressions as public opinion
forces duties up or down. The wool-growers had no
thought, however, of accepting the situation as long as they
had political power. Judge William Lawrence, the president
of the National Wool-Growers Association, kept up a
clamor throughout the campaign, and when the new bill was
under consideration, demanded rates higher than wool had
ever received. He was sternly rebuked by strong protectionists
for his greed. “Any revision of the tariff,” one influential
interest allied to him, said, “which carried such rates
of duty on this raw material, would not only fatally hamper
the American wool manufacturer, but would excite on the
part of the people such natural opposition, by reason of their
prohibitory character, that their enactment would necessarily
be followed by agitation for their repeal, an agitation which
would grow and gather and continue until it finally resulted
in still another tariff revision, perhaps at the end of four
years. To insure any degree of permanence to the tariff
law about to be enacted it is necessary that, in so important
a schedule as this, it shall commend itself to the popular judgment
as one constructed on fairly conservative lines. The
schedule proposed by Judge Lawrence far exceeds in its proposed
rates of duty any schedule ever before demanded with
reference to any article, either raw or manufactured, in connection
with any revision of the tariff ever undertaken in the
United States.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is not necessary in this connection to undertake any
analysis of these proposals. Their significance will at once
be apparent to every wool manufacturer. Their enactment
would be tantamount to a blanket provision in the law to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>effect that ‘the importation of wools of foreign growth is
prohibited, on and after the passage of this act.’ Such a
wool schedule would not only be fatal to the wool manufacturer,
but equally fatal to the wool-grower; for it would
enormously restrict the use of domestic wool, which would be
superseded by foreign wool imported in the manufactured
form.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Judge Lawrence and his Association, as had been
proved in 1883 and again in 1890, held moderate protection as
little better than free trade. They wished to shut out all
foreign wool. They refused to modify their demands now,
and when both House and Senate Committees put the rates
down, they turned on their representatives with a demand
that their wants be satisfied. That they could rally a group
strong enough to defeat the bill was plain. The Western
silver Senators were also wool Senators. They took no
interest in the bill as a party measure; they would gladly
defeat it if it did not give them what they wanted. Moreover,
the demand for a duty on wool was supported by a
group of Eastern woollen manufacturers who had always
exercised great political power. This was the group known as
the National Association of Wool Manufacturers. Although
they deplored Judge Lawrence’s extreme demands, they stood
for a duty on wool. In the judgment of this Association,
they must either support the wool duty or be prepared to
abandon their own protection; accordingly they now resolved
that “an impartial application of the principle of
protection is essential to a complete and uniform development
of the industrial resources of the nation,” and they
“earnestly” seconded the appeal for a duty on wool. This
resolution they sent to the wool-growers, who naturally had
always been suspicious of the support of men willing to work
for a law which made their own materials dearer, with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>private note, assuring them that “a spirit of sympathy and
fellowship” towards all wool-growers animated the Association.
That his spirit was far from animating all in the business,
the loud protests against taxing wool which came from
many leading but non-political woollen manufacturers at
this time is evidence. So strong was the vote the wool
interest mustered that the Senate finally yielded in its fight
for the lower duty. Eight and 9 cents a pound on clothing
and combing wool were what it had been struggling for;
10 and 11 cents were granted: but when the bill went into
conference these rates were advanced to 11 and 12 cents,
making the duties exactly what they were in the McKinley
Bill. The duty on wool of the third class, that is, on carpet
wool, was raised higher than in the bill of 1890, an entirely
indefensible increase. We did not then and do not now raise
carpet wool in this country. Our land is too valuable.
But the Western growers of coarse wool had been told that
carpet wool was being imported free for use in cloth-making,
that it was “deplacing” American wool, and they had demanded
that it should be taxed. It is probable that a small
amount of carpet wool did and still does find its way into certain
clothes, but it is a negligible amount, and to put a tax
upon the raw material of an entire industry, making every
yard of domestic carpet dearer for the sake of protecting the
scared wool-growers of the West against a purely imaginary
competition was as silly as it was unjust.</p>

<p class='c007'>The demand of the wool-growers that the prohibitive duties
on all kinds of wool substitutes be restored, was imperative.
By raising the cry of “shoddy” they could wrest a duty from
Congress on any material, no matter how valuable to the
manufacturer. Perhaps no word has been more unjustly
degraded in the history of industry in this country. The world
has never produced enough raw wool to meet the demand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>for woollens. It has always been necessary and probably
always will be necessary, to use wool waste and wool rags.
Ingenious machines have been devised for preparing all this
material for the manufacturer. It is a legitimate part of the
business, and one that helps to provide warm, cheap clothing
for the poor. “It would be as unreasonable,” says one
authority, “to despise paper makers because they use up
linen rags, or to despise dyers who use colors made from coal
tar, as to despise manufacturers who use up waste woollen
rags as shoddy. It is said that 125,000,000 pounds of shoddy,
mungo, etc., are manufactured into wool every year in England
alone. If this immense quantity were wasted, it is
difficult to estimate the increase which would take place in
the price of wool and the consequent dearness of cloth; but
the result would be that countless persons would be unable
to afford proper clothing.” The wool-growers cut off all
importations of shoddy in the new schedule. It would
displace American wool. As we shall see, it drove the manufacturers,
not to use more wool, but to find a substitute for
wool.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course, the McKinley rates on raw wool meant the
McKinley rates on woollen goods, that is, if the National
Association could get them. In principle, they were those of
the compact of 1867, between the two wings of the wool
industry, which rates have already been explained. They
provided for compound duties; that is, one set of duties which
made up to the manufacturer for the tax he paid on his raw
material—the aim being, of course, to put him on the same
basis as his foreign rival—and a second set which was purely
protective. In estimating the first class of duties, the
National Association demanded that four pounds of wool
should be reckoned to a pound of cloth. It had been shown
again and again that it was only “sometimes” that this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>amount of wool was required for a pound of cloth, that the
effect of the ratio was to make all of the heavy-shrinking wools
for which four or more pounds were needed too dear to be
imported, and at the same to give an entirely unnecessary
compensation to cloth goods made from wools which shrink
but slightly. When the point was made, the National Association
raised a hue and cry, and Congress was warned to
respect its influence as it had been in 1890. When it came to
the duties for protection the Association which had protested
against the greed of the wool-growers in demanding high
duties showed themselves equally greedy and more successful;
for the wool-growers, except in the case of carpet wools, which
we do not produce, had to content themselves with the McKinley
rates, while the woollen manufacturers were able to
raise the duty on the goods which are chiefly imported to
the highest point it had ever touched, 55 per cent. It is
interesting to note that in the compact of 1867, to which
the Association constantly appealed in the making of the
Dingley Bill as it had in earlier bills, 25 per cent was considered
a proper protection for the goods on which the Association
now asked and received 55 per cent. When the bill
finally passed the Conference it carried the same puzzling
provision for a duty on wool tops as had been put into the
McKinley Bill on the suggestion of the then president of the
National Association of Wool Manufacturers, Mr. William
Whitman. As we have seen, this was not a clearly stated
figure: tops were to carry the duty of the basket clause of the
schedule. Figured out, this amounted to a higher duty on
tops than the bill provided for yarn, which is the more
advanced stage of wool on its way to cloth. There was opposition
to this duty and grumblings of manipulation, but it
was many years before the truth about it became public
property.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>The success of the National Association in getting into the
bill exactly what it wanted was generally believed by those
who knew what was going on in Washington at this time
to be due to the confidential relations with the Finance
Committee of the secretary of the Association, S. N. D.
North. During the making of the Wilson Bill, Mr. North
was known to have had a desk in the office of Senator Aldrich,
and from that vantage ground to have made a desperate but
unsuccessful attempt to secure for the industry he represented
something of the favor which other lobbyists were wresting
from the Democrats. During the making of the Dingley
Bill he occupied the same inside position. To all appearances
he was a confidential clerk of Mr. Aldrich’s; as a matter
of fact, he was a paid representative of the woollen manufacturers,
looking after their interests while apparently
aiding the Finance Committee as he could. That Mr.
Aldrich, himself, did not understand the real nature of the
wool schedule finally adopted, one can hardly doubt, for he
told Mr. North at the time, according to a letter the latter
gentleman wrote to Mr. Whitman: “I don’t suppose this
tariff is going to last long, because the rates are so high; but
I am perfectly willing that the wool manufacturers should
have all that there is in it and that the tail should go with
the hide.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The influence on the bill of this despotic power of the wool
interests was similar to that of sugar on the Wilson Bill,
but it did not make itself clear in the Senate as it had in the
earlier bill. It came out in the conference of the two Houses
which followed the passage of the bill by the Senate on
July 7. Some 872 amendments had been tacked to the
measure and the conference spent nearly a fortnight over
them. When finally reported, the rates were generally higher
than either the House or Senate had advised. It was impossible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>to give to wool all it demanded on a threat of defeating
the bill, unless other interests were favored, and so it
happened that when the Dingley Bill was finally passed, it
was, on the whole, a more oppressive measure than the McKinley
Bill. Moreover, it was made more oppressive by a
House and Senate whose leaders had declared from the beginning
of their work that the country asked and had been promised
moderate duties. It was as real a breaking of promises
as the Wilson Bill was a surrender of principles.</p>

<p class='c007'>And there was a general feeling among those who had made
it, and in the Administration itself, that as Mr. Aldrich told
Mr. North, duties were too high and would have to come
down. What would have happened if the public mind had
continued to be occupied with the tariff as it had in 1890 and
in 1894, it is difficult to say. It is not probable that there
would have been any such revolt as the McKinley Bill
caused. The disillusion the country had suffered over the
ability of the Democrats to carry out consistent reforms
was too keen. Moreover, what industry wanted and
needed more than anything else was to be let alone; even
the most irreconcilable of tariff-for-revenue only men could
have hardly counselled another revision at this juncture.
The Dingley Bill, bad as it was, did not stir the popular
mind. Silver occupied it, and silver was soon displaced by
the most absorbing interest which a country can have—a
war—and the war was followed by the question of imperialism,
and imperialism was not settled before the country
had entered on a period of such magnificent and bewildering
prosperity as it had never before dreamed. The heavy
decline in prices which had begun in 1891 reached its lowest
point for raw materials at the end of 1896, for manufactured
goods in 1897. It was not until 1904 that the prices which
manufacturers had received in 1890 were reëstablished, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>after they were once reached, they soared rapidly far beyond.
As for raw materials, they regained the ground they had lost
much more quickly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wealth of all descriptions began to increase in an unheard
of way. In 1897 the gold and silver produced in the United
States was worth something over $89,000,000; in 1900 this
had risen to $115,000,000, and in 1905, to over $122,000,000.
While in 1897 we produced over 8,500,000 tons of pig-iron, in
1905 it was 16,500,000, and we were consuming about all we
produced. Of bituminous coal in these three years we produced
respectively 131,000,000, 189,000,000, and 281,000,000
tons. Of wheat we grew in 1897 over 530,000,000 bushels,
about the same in 1900, and in 1905 nearly 700,000,000
bushels. The cotton crop in 1897 was valued at $319,500,000;
in 1900 at $511,000,000, and in 1905 at $632,000,000. Our
hay averaged an annual value in this period of over
$500,000,000; our potato crop something like $150,000,000.
The value of our farm animals in 1897 was about $1,655,000,000;
in 1900 it was $2,280,000,000; and in 1905 over
$3,000,000,000. And so one might go on recording phenominal
growths of almost everything which the earth yields
in return for man’s labor. And never before had there been
so rapid an increase in the number of laborers available.
We could bring in labor free and in this period we used
the privileges as never before. Immigration which in 1897
was but 230,000 rose in 1900 to 448,500; and in 1905 to
over 1,000,000. The great bulk of these newcomers were
men of a working age, that is, over fifteen and under forty.
These great numbers were added annually to those who
already were at work in the country until in 1900 nearly
30,000,000 people were busy in this country, drawing from
the earth the materials of wealth, moulding them to men’s
uses, and transporting them to the markets where they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>wanted, and these markets were not those of the United
States alone. Our home consumption was enormous, but
we bought and sold with all the nations of the earth in constantly
increasing quantities, selling always many millions
more than we bought.</p>

<p class='c007'>How much had the Dingley Bill to do with this great outpouring
of wealth? It certainly did not cause it. A wave
of prosperity was sweeping around the globe, as one of depression
had from 1891 to 1897; England, Germany, France, and
the Orient, shared in the blessings. The Dingley Bill could
neither retard nor accelerate this. It could not and did not
grow a potato or produce a gold nugget, but it no doubt did
cause more of the materials we were producing to be manufactured
at home than would have been done under the
Wilson Bill. Without it much of the capital and labor given
to manufacturing would have gone to agricultural uses and
commerce. Sheltered from competition, men aimed to make
in the country all that a highly prosperous home market
would consume of necessaries, of novelties, of ingenious conveniences,
and of luxuries. The Dingley Bill relieved the
manufacturer of the necessity of considering what was doing
in his trade in other nations. This enormous advantage
enticed more capital proportionally than into other lines of
industry. And as the industry expanded, immigration was
excited. Manufacturing as conducted to-day requires much
cheap labor. Save in the skilled work where comparatively
few are needed, American labor—naturalized foreign labor,
will not stay long. Immigration was necessary in order to
supply the cheap labor the textile and the steel and iron industries
needed. That is, the Dingley Bill may be credited with
adding two or three hundred thousand consumers yearly to
our domestic market. The value of this addition is doubtful
when we examine the standard of living of the immigrants,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>the amount of their earnings sent home, and the large proportion
of those who are transient, that is, who return to their
native land to end their days: just what this proportion is, it
is impossible to say, but something of its size may be judged
from the steerage passengers sailing annually from the ports
of the United States. In 1900, for instance, 448,572 persons
came in by steerage, and 293,404 went out. In 1905 1,026,494
came in, and 536,151 went out. The value of the increase in
the size of the domestic market, which may fairly be credited
to the Dingley Bill, is less impressive also when it is compared
with the value of the markets of many millions we might have
been conquering at this time if we had had the shipping on
the seas which we once had, and which, as already has been
seen, we have destroyed by prohibitive tariffs on iron and
steel and lumber, and by hampering navigation laws.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first uneasiness over the bill which its authors felt
was along the line of foreign markets. We were not conquering
them as rapidly as we ought, or as we must, if our tremendous
production was to be disposed of. That which the
thoughtful had been warning against was happening. In our
zeal to produce, we had not intelligently arranged what we
were to do with our products. The Dingley Bill had, it is
true, provided a scheme of reciprocity. The really important
provision in the scheme gave the President power to
negotiate trade treaties with any country, subject to ratifications
by the Senate. Mr. McKinley soon after his inauguration
appointed a special plenipotentiary to negotiate these
treaties,—John H. Kasson, who had always been a moderate
protectionist, and who had seen the capitulation of the
party to the manufacturers of the country with disgust and
dread. Mr. Kasson undertook the work with enthusiasm.
By 1900 he had several treaties signed and before the Senate.
The most important one was with France. By this treaty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>we could import into her territory a very large number of
articles at a minimum duty, and we in return were to give her
a reduced duty on many of her products. Not only Mr.
Kasson, but Mr. McKinley himself urged the ratification of
these treaties. There was no doubt but that the public
generally favored them. But there had appeared in opposition
the same forces which had made the McKinley Bill, the
Wilson Bill, and Dingley Bill what they were,—political
measures, trading contracts, by which for so much influence,
so much duty was given. These nervous, superstitious, and
greedy forces decided against reciprocity. The nature of
their opposition was very well summarized in one of the
hearings on the subject by a manufacturer who was himself
in favor of the French treaty.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We have striven to know, both before coming to Washington
and since our arrival here, what are the objections to the treaty.
We have been informed that the knit-goods manufacturers have
been opposed to the ratification of the treaty. We are now informed
that of the $100,000,000 worth of knit-goods consumed in
the country last year, only $240,000 came from France. We have
been informed that the manufacturers of pottery and silks were
opposed to the ratification of the treaty. We are now told that
both industries have admitted that no injury would be suffered by
them. We have learned that the manufacturers of spectacles
have believed that they would suffer injury, but they were shown
that there would still remain to them eighty-eight per cent of the
present tariff; they have been satisfied to believe that no injury
would come to them. We have been informed that the manufacturers
of imitation jewellery object to the ratification of the treaty.
We understand that the treaty proposed to reduce the duty from
60 to 57 per cent. We are further informed that the probabilities
are that the result of the treaty will increase far more largely the
exports of this class of manufacturers from the United States to
France than they import from France to the United States.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>“We have heard that opposition to the ratification of the treaty
has been based upon the proposed reduction in our tariff on prunes.
We find that our exports of prunes to France amount to $260,000,
while the imports of prunes from France to the United States
amount to $14,000. We have understood that manufacturers of
chemicals, gloves, and braids have stated that they will be injured
by the ratification of the treaty. After an honest effort to learn the
facts in the case, we are reduced to the conclusion that in actual
working of this treaty the injuries suffered by them would be problematical
in every case, and imaginary in most cases.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Treaty after treaty was negotiated, but in spite of urgency
from the most respectable sources, Congress refused to act
on them, and finally in March, 1901, Mr. Kasson resigned.
His chief did not give up the cause, however, for in the memorable
Buffalo speech of September 5, 1901, Mr. McKinley said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“The period of exclusiveness is past. The expansion of our
trade and commerce is the pressing problem. Reciprocity treaties
are in harmony with the spirit of the times; measures of retaliation
are not. If, perchance, some of our tariffs are no longer needed
for revenue, or to encourage and protect our industries at home,
why should they not be employed to expand and promote our
markets abroad?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The very essence of all this opposition to free or freer
exchange on the part of the manufacturers was the fear of
lower prices and cheaper goods. They held as a part of their
narrow economic philosophy, the theory that the cheap coat
makes a cheap man, that prosperity means limited production
and high prices. At bottom, the manufacturer eliminates
from his calculations all consideration of the consumer. But
the consumer exists, and finally, in spite of the enormous
prosperity of the country, the consumer was heard from. The
Dingley Bill about 1900 began to hit the rocks for which it
had from the start been headed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <span class='large'>WHERE EVERY PENNY COUNTS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The last man to be heard from in the making of the Dingley
Bill, as indeed of its predecessors, was the man who was to
buy the goods. In 1896, when the tariff hearings were going
on, Mr. Louis Brandeis of Boston, at that time unknown
outside of his own professional circle, appeared “for the consumers”
as he told the Committee. He was laughed at for
his pains. “What’s the use?” was Mr. Dalzell’s protest;
“Oh, let him run down,” his sneer, when Mr. Brandeis insisted
that it was his right to say what he thought about
duties which made his necessaries dearer. A recurring note
in the hearings held in Washington, before the Payne-Aldrich
Bill, was contempt for the suggestion that this or that duty
made an article cost a cent or two more at retail. What was
a cent to a consumer! This was particularly noticeable in
the argument of the wool interests. What if the tariff did
make the cloth for a suit of clothes a few cents dearer a yard—it
did not add a large amount to the price of the cheap suit.
It was not worth considering.</p>

<p class='c007'>What is a cent to a consumer? Are there a considerable
number of people in this country living on incomes so small
that a rise of a cent or two in the price of necessary articles
of food and clothing can make a material difference to them?
To most Americans “the poor” in the United States are a
negligible quantity. We think of them as the frayed and
falling fringe on our great fabric of “comfortable off” population—largely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>what they are by their own indolence or
inefficiency. But is this true? Is it not true, on the contrary,
that the great majority of the inhabitants of the country,
the great mass of hard-working, industrious men and
women are poor? The statistics of the distribution of
wealth should be often set before those hopeful souls, who,
prosperous themselves, love to insist that, in this country at
least, “all is for the best in the best possible of worlds.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We have 92,000,000 people in the United States. Perhaps
there are a few thousand millionnaires among us, perhaps a
few hundred thousand having an income of ten thousand
dollars or more. But in contrast to them there are millions
of individuals whose wage is <i>under</i> a thousand. Look over
the average yearly wages in our best-paid industries. Take
the one which boasts of paying the highest wage—the United
States Steel Trust. According to its last report the average
wage of its 195,500 employees, <i>including</i> its foremen and clerks
and managers, whose salaries in some cases are $10,000 even
$25,000 a year, was but $775. In 1905 the average yearly
earnings of the men in the cotton industry was but $416. In
1907 the mule spinners in the Massachusetts woollen factories
averaged $13.16 a week, the dyers averaged $8.58, the weavers
$11.60. There are probably several millions of white families
in the United States whose average wage is not over $500 a
year. When one comes to examine industries generally, the
surprise is not how <i>much</i>, but how <i>little</i> the great body of wage-earners
receive. People must live on small earnings in this
country, as everywhere. In order to accumulate enough to
provide against sickness and old age they are obliged to practise
a thrift which frequently is hateful, it is so cruel. Moreover,
genuine thrift requires so much training, intelligence,
and self-denial that comparatively few are prepared to practise
it, even with the best of intentions. This is the hard fact,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>and yet the Congress of the United States for fifty years has
fixed taxes on the food and clothing and shelter of these people
with no apparent consciousness of their condition. They
were the “ultimate consumers”—terms in a problem—not
suffering, struggling men and women.</p>

<p class='c007'>If one would know with something like scientific precision
what it means for a family to live on $500 or less a year in a
city like New York, for instance, if he would realize the relation
of a rise of even a cent in the cost of a necessity to the comfort
of the multitude of working girls in this country on $6.00
and $8.00 a week, he should study the various investigations
recently made into the budgets of these two classes. They
demonstrate that if one is to take care of a family of five persons
in New York City on $500 a year, or of himself on a wage
of $6.00 or $8.00 a week, he must think before he buys a penny
newspaper, and he must save and plan for months to get a
yearly holiday for the family at Coney Island; that there is
practically no possibility of a nest egg or of schooling for the
children beyond fourteen years of age, that sickness means
debt or charity, and that the accumulation of those things
which make for comfort and beauty in a home is out of the
question. To these families an increase of a cent in the price
of a quart of milk is something like a catastrophe. To these
girls, every penny added to the cost of food, of coal, of common
articles of clothing, means simply less food, less warmth, less
covering, when at the best they never can have enough of
any one of these necessaries. These budgets are a powerful
demonstration that the rapid rise in the cost of living under
the Dingley Bill was to a vast number of people of this
country nothing less than a tragedy, for what is true in New
York City is equally true in Chicago, in Pittsburg, and in
many factory towns. The statistics, which show the rise in
prices from 1897 onward, are as sensational as those which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>show the increase in national wealth. For instance, take
what the bulletin of the Labor Bureau calls the “annual per
capita cost of the necessaries of daily consumption.” It rose
from $74.31 in 1896 to $107.26 in 1906. Coal which cost
$3.50 a ton in 1896 cost $4.50 in 1906. Manufactured commodities
were 32 per cent higher in 1906 than ten years
before, raw commodities, 50 per cent higher. “All commodities”
averaged 35.4 per cent higher. Rents soared everywhere.
That wages increased largely in many industries in
this decade is equally true, but that they increased correspondingly
in any but the most favored industries—those
where either the Unions exercised compelling power or those
where the managers were unusually enlightened—is doubtful.
A government investigation of the wages in about
4000 establishments, employing 334,000 persons, engaged in
manufacturing and mechanical industries, the kind of establishments
where, of course, the forces which raise wages act
most freely and successfully, shows that in 1906 the weekly
wages of the 334,000 were 19.1 per cent higher than in
1896, while, as said, the cost of all commodities was 35
per cent higher. Wages increased 3.9 per cent in 1906 over
1905, while the cost of the commodities increased 5.9 per cent.
Now what does this mean? Why, simply this, that at a
time when wealth was rolling up as never before (this country
increased its wealth between 1900 and 1904 by about
twenty billions of dollars), a vast number of hard-working
people in this country were really having a more difficult time
making ends meet than they have ever had before. It also
means that in a great number of other hard-working families
the increase in wages had been so little in excess of the increase
in the cost of living that it may be almost said to have been
a discouragement instead of a comfort, by intensifying the
common conviction of the working-man that no matter how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>much he earns he will still have to spend it all in the same
hard struggle to get on, that there is no such thing for him as
getting ahead.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no escaping the seriousness of such a situation.
The only chance of peace and of permanency in this country
lies in securing for the laboring classes an increasing share of
increasing wealth. It is not enough that the wages of men
keep up with their forced expenditures,—they must go beyond.
There must be a <i>growing</i> margin between the two—a
margin wide enough for the laborer to see it, and to be able to
draw hope and encouragement from it. When the margin
has shrunk or not visibly increased, unrest and discouragement
must follow. There is no doubt that a great number of employers
in this country recognize this principle, and thousands
of them are struggling to meet it by increasing wages. But
there is another duty for us, and that is to keep down the cost
of living. And it is this duty which the makers of tariff
bills have always refused to face squarely and, as far as the
tariff had any relation to it, honestly to discharge. That the
Dingley Bill had not been the only cause of the increasing
burden which the consumer bore is true, but it was a real
cause, and in the case of certain essential common articles,
almost the only cause. Take for illustration the case of the
tariff and spool cotton. Spool cotton is as necessary an article
of daily consumption in the household as fuel or cloth. Many
women with families, on $500 a year, many shop and factory
girls on $6.00 or $8.00 a week, make their own clothes. Not infrequently
these women in their work are obliged, when not
protected by a Union, to furnish their own thread. For
many years the price of the ordinary 200–yard spool cotton
was 5 cents, twelve spools for 50 cents, when suddenly in
1900 it was advanced to 6 cents, about double the price it was
selling for in England. The cause of the advance offers one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>of the nicest studies we have of the beneficent effects on prices
of a tariff combined with a trust.</p>

<p class='c007'>The leading brand of thread which was sold in 1900 at
6 cents in New York and about half that in England, is made
by J. &amp; P. Coats, Limited, of Paisley, Scotland, and by the
Coats thread combination in this country. The Coats House
is the oldest and most progressive thread house in the world.
It early saw the advantage of establishing a factory in the
United States and competing for the American trade under
the protection of the tariff. Other English firms also saw the
advantage, chief among them the Clarke Mile End Spool
Cotton Company of Newark, New Jersey. A few years ago the
Coatses realized that a combination of the English concerns
doing business here would be profitable, and one was brought
about, the products of the amalgamation being handled by
the Spool Cotton Company of New York City. In 1897
some sixteen of the English competitors of the Coats’s concern
combined in a $10,000,000 trust, called the English Sewing
Cotton Trust. The J. &amp; P. Coats Company took $1,000,000
of the stock, and at least once since has helped the organization
out of trouble by lending it $2,000,000. Thus the two
concerns are working together. The next year, after the
English combination was formed—1898—an American
Thread Trust Company was formed. It was made up of the
thirteen leading American concerns,—all, indeed, but one of
the large domestic companies went into it. No sooner was
this done than the English Trust bought the majority of
the American Trust’s stock. Here, then, was an English Trust
owning and controlling the American Trust and dictating its
policy from the other side of the water. And this British
Trust was affiliated and partly owned by the still larger concern,
the J. &amp; P. Coats Company. It comes down to this,
that the $48,000,000 Coats concern controls practically the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>thread business of England and America. No sooner was
the English control complete here than the price of thread
was advanced.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Archibald Coats, the head of the Paisley concern,
when twitted with using his monopoly to put up the price of
thread, insisted that the advance was due entirely to the
higher costs of materials. Moreover, he said, the concern
was not a monopoly, that there were in the world 180 thread
concerns outside of those in which he was interested. Mr.
Coats’s materials were higher—cotton, fuel, spool-wood, had
advanced, but on the other hand, Mr. Coats himself called
attention to the savings he and his colleagues effected by their
combination, both in manufacturing and in selling. These
economies the representatives of the American end of the
Trust told the Industrial Commission in 1900 were “immense,”
“tremendous.” Mr. Coats stated in his report of
1906 that the profits of his concern in the second five years
of the combination—that is, after the price of thread went
up, and also after the price of materials had gone up—were
nearly a third greater than in the first five years. They
certainly were highly satisfactory,—a profit of $12,636,000
a year on a capital of $48,600,000 is doing well! The fact
seems to be that through a monopoly in this country which it
was possible to perfect only because of the high tariff on spool
cotton which had cut off all competition from the 180 concerns
which in free-trade England might affect him somewhat,
Mr. Coats was able to sell his thread here at a higher price
than he did in England and to increase his profits in five years
by some 33½ per cent, and this in a time when his materials
had largely advanced. That is, Mr. Coats and his friends
had been able to make the millions of this and other lands
bear all the fluctuations and vicissitudes of the thread trade.
Whatever happens, he could protect himself and his favored
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>workmen from sharing any of the losses of his business; he
could even increase his profits.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the necessary articles which steadily advanced in
price after the Dingley Bill passed, was shoes. It was an
advance which was particularly hard on the poor, for shoes
are one of the heaviest expenses in clothing a family. One of
the budgets reported in a recent investigation of living expenses
in New York City was that of a family of four persons,
respectable, hard-working, and anxious to get ahead. Their
total income was $600. These four persons kept themselves
“neat and clean” on $40.00 a year. Out of this $40.00, $11.81,
<i>or over one-fourth of the total, went for shoes and mending shoes</i>.
In another budget of a larger amount ($895) $61.90 was spent
for clothing in a family of eight persons, and out of this $8.00
went for shoes for the father, $1.25 for the mother, $8.33 for the
six children, or $17.58 of the entire appropriation for clothes
and shoes. In the budget of a shop girl there is perhaps no
one item which costs more anxiety than that of shoes, none
more important. She <i>must</i> have them. They should be
strong and weather-proof, for she must go and come in pouring
rains and drifting snows. They should be well fitting, for
she must often stand in them all day. The amounts spent
in keeping themselves shod vary greatly, of course, according
to the care of the girls, the distance they walk, the quality of
the article bought; but when compared with the total allowance
for clothes, the result is something appalling. Among
the budgets of a recent investigation, was one of a woman
forty years old, who had worked sixteen years at $6.00 a week
in a well-managed New York factory. She sat at her work.
She could have earned $8.00 a week by taking a place at the
counter, but argued that the better clothes required and the
wear and tear of standing would be really more expensive, so
kept the $6.00 place. By limiting food she could save $1.00 a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>week. This gave her $53.00 a year for doctor, dentist, amusements,
clothing, and “extras.” She spent $22.05 for clothes the
year her budget was examined, and of this $7.16 went for shoes
and rubbers. This woman was an especially careful person.
Usually the sum credited to shoes is larger. They range from
this one of $7.16 up to $26.60 spent by a girl who said she
could not keep her feet dry on less than a pair of $2 shoes per
month—$24.00 a year—with one pair for dress at $2.60;
$26 for shoes on an income of $9.00 a week, cut down the year
of the investigation to an average of $7.50 by illness!</p>

<p class='c007'>It was hard enough for the poor to buy shoes before the
Dingley tariff, but with every year since it has been harder.
In woman’s ordinary shoes there was an increase of something
like 25 per cent in the years from 1890 to 1899. There was
a corresponding increase in all varieties of boots and shoes.
Say that it has been 20 per cent and see what that means to
your family of four which can spend but $40.00 a year on
clothes and must put $11.81 of it on shoes.</p>

<p class='c007'>But why should the price of shoes have increased? Under
the extraordinary advance in shoe machinery, it should have
decreased. The shoe was pinched by a combination of tariffs
and trusts which can hardly be matched in any other industry
in the country. First, there was the tariff laid on hides
in 1897. For twenty-five years hides had been free and cheap,
for South America sent us large quantities. The shoe dealers
were taking all both markets offered. But the cattle-growers
of the West raised a cry that they should have more money
for their hides, that Congress should pass a law which would
compel the people to give it to them. In 1890 a strong appeal
was made to Mr. McKinley for such a duty and it is probable
that he would have granted it, so great was his reverence for
the doctrine, had not Mr. Blaine interfered. The duty was
not granted in 1890, but in 1897 it was given. The effect was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>immediately to raise the price of sole leather. In June,
1906, W. L. Douglas, ex-Governor of Massachusetts, a shoe
manufacturer, said in a public speech that since 1897 the
increase to his company in the price of sole leather in a single
pair of shoes had amounted to 17½ cents. Mr. Douglas
figured that the tariff on hides and soles caused the people of
this country to pay $30,000,000 a year more for shoes than
they otherwise would. They paid this tax that perhaps
85,000 stock-raisers, herders, and drovers might get more for
their cattle. It was argued that with the duty they could
monopolize the domestic trade and cut off the South American
trader, but that gentleman sent us more hides in 1906 than in
any year since the duty was imposed! Moreover, it was not
the cattle raiser who was chiefly or proportionately profited
by the higher price. It was the Beef Trust, as Mr. Blaine said
it would be. The cattleman received no such increase in the
price of his steers as the beef men did in the price of hides. In
November, 1907, the <cite>Hide and Leather Journal</cite>, commenting
on the good thing the Trust had always made out of this
particular duty, declared it was paying stock-raisers $12.50
apiece for cows, and selling the hides alone for $9.00 apiece!</p>

<p class='c007'>But it takes something besides leather to make shoes. For
one thing it takes thread—and thread, linen thread particularly,
so advanced in price that it added perceptibly to the
cost of making a pair of shoes. But why had thread advanced?
It is a pretty study of combined tariff and trust
manipulation. To begin with, we do not and never have
raised in this country any flax suitable for making linen
thread. In spite of this fact the Dingley Bill put a duty of
$22.40 a ton on flax not dressed, and of $67.20 per ton on that
which had been dressed. These were the rates of the McKinley
Bill. Of course the avowed purpose of this duty was
to protect the “infant industry” of raising flax for use in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>manufacturing. We have a good flax acreage in this country—though
it has decreased by over 1,000,000 acres since 1902.
But this flax is grown not for the fibre, but for the seed, being
used for making linseed oil. It is the custom not to harvest
it until the seeds are fully ripe, and when that time comes the
straw is too old for fibre. It is true that in the Northwest
a few tons of flax are used annually for making twine, upholstering
tow, and insulating boards, but practically none of this
is fit for making thread,—that is, <i>in spite of the fact that we
have been steadily paying from $20.00 to $22.00 a ton on undressed
flax for many years, we have scarcely ever produced a ton
fit for thread</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course the thread itself is protected, and this protection
has worked in the linen thread industry very much as that on
cotton thread. Seeing the tariff trend here, the great linen
thread manufacturers of Great Britain followed the example
of the Coats’s and Clarke’s cotton thread makers, and came
here many years ago to produce under the protection of the
tariff the thread they had been exporting. This went on
until the Barbours of Lisburn, Ireland, had a branch at Paterson,
New Jersey; the Finlaysons of Johnstone, Scotland, at
Grafton, Massachusetts; the Dunbar Co. of Gilford, Ireland,
at Greenwich, New York; the Marshals of Leeds, England,
at Newark, New Jersey—all of the great British companies
were here to preserve the market for themselves. Most
efficient masters of their business—the Barbours were a
century-old house—they grew rapidly under the high protection
they enjoyed. The logic of their privilege was of
course what it has been in all our highly protected industries—a
trust. This came about a few years ago—the
Linen Thread Company of which the president is Mr. William
Barbour, and the vice-president A. R. Turner. The formation
of the trust did wonders for the linen thread business.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>They were able to make large economies. Instead of separate
mills making all the products each mill was assigned to
do the work it could best do. At the same time the marketing
expenses were reduced. In one of the communications to the
tariff hearings of 1908–1909, a writer familiar with the industry
says of these economies:</p>

<p class='c007'>“One mill which, while independent, used to make $400,000
worth of thread per annum now makes $600,000, and another
which made $250,000 now makes $400,000, an increased turnoff
of about fifty per cent, and this without hiring an additional
hand. This, of course, lessens the cost of manufacturing
considerably. When the four mills were selling independently
on this side, each of them carried stock in New
York, Boston, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco, and
each had travelling men going over the territory. But with
the advent of the combination all the stores in the various
cities were turned into one, and a much smaller force is used
to sell the products of the various mills.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Now of course if the theory of the trust is sound, we should
get some benefit from this combination on shoe thread, the
only one of its products which we consider here. But what
happened to shoe thread? In the last few years every variety
has advanced rapidly. Increase in cost of materials—increase
in rents—rapacious dealers—the trust people tell
you. But the facts are these according to an expert authority:
the linen thread trust were selling their shoe threads in 1909
for at least 50 per cent more on an average than they cost
them, and they were able to do this almost entirely because
of the duty which protected them from foreign competition.
The cost of producing in Ireland a shoe thread known in the
trade as No. 1 is 40 cents a pound. In the United States it is
47 cents. The duty on this thread was 19¾ cents a pound—12¾
cents more than was necessary to cover difference in cost—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>the trust sold the thread 71 <i>cents net</i> a pound! No. 4
shoe thread cost 53 cents to make in Ireland. It cost 64
cents here. There was a duty of 25 cents a pound on it, and
it sold at $1.20 a pound, nearly <i>twice what it cost!</i> In two
years (1907–1908) its price jumped <i>three</i> times.</p>

<p class='c007'>And what is the attitude of the Linen Thread Trust toward
the protective tariff? Its members signed a petition to the
Ways and Means Committee in 1909 in which they prayed
that the duty be kept on flax. They wished to “encourage
the fibre-producing industry,” they said—although they
knew, nobody better, that no flax fibre for thread has ever
been grown here, in spite of more than thirty years of tax-paying.
Of course they asked that the duty on thread be
untouched!</p>

<p class='c007'>But a high protection tariff and a trust agreement are not
the only advantages the Linen Thread Company enjoys. It
has an alliance which gives it a commanding strategic position
in the business, and that is with the organization popularly
known as the “shoe-machinery trust.” This company began
its life twelve years ago in New Jersey like so many of its
kind. At that time, 1899, it was capitalized at $25,000,000,
divided into preferred and common stock, the first at six per
cent, the second at eight per cent. Six years after its organization
the company underwent a reorganization. This reorganization
seems to have been a way of getting rid of its extra
earnings, for it presented its stockholders with comfortable
extra cash dividends as well as a fifty per cent common stock
dividend. According to the last report to which the writer
has had access, 1907–1908, the capital of the company had in
eight years increased from $17,250,000 to nearly $32,000,000,
its surplus from $1,355,914 to over $13,500,000, and the net
earnings from $1,770,110 to over $4,500,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>One may fairly ask how they did it. It is clear enough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>when one looks at what they have had to go on. In the first
place, the shoes of this country are now made almost entirely
by machines. The first practical machine invented was the
famous McKay sewing machine. It was followed rapidly by
others: machines for welting, lasting, heeling, pegging, more
than a score for performing the many complicated operations
by which the modern “ready-made” shoe is built up. Up to
1899 these various machines were handled by different companies.
But in that year the twelve most important concerns
were combined into the trust named above, officially the
United Shoe Machinery Company. Now there prevails and
has since the days of McKay—who, by the way, was not the
inventor but the promoter of the first shoe machine—a
system of handling its output peculiar in manufacturing industries.
It never sells, it always <i>rents</i> its machines. That is, a
maker of shoes cannot buy for his factory the machines to
do his work, as the ship-builder, the miller, the woollen manufacturer,
can. He rents the machines for a term of years,
paying a royalty on each shoe made. When the shoe machinery
company was formed in 1899, it inherited this curious
method. It took hold of its various acquisitions with rare
energy and ability, its aim being to produce what it calls a
system of shoe manufacturing. To accomplish this it proposed
to “tie” together the machines it controls in such a
way as to give a practical continuity of service. That is,
each machine was to be so adjusted to the others that the
shoe could be passed from one to another without loss of
time or waste of effort. To do this effectually meant improving
the old machines as well as adding new ones. The results
of the combination of machines and of the improvement are
extraordinary. It is a practically continuous service enabling
the manufacturer to increase his product, and the laborer, who
in the shoe industry is paid by the piece, to increase his earnings.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>The management of the new organization proposed at the
start not to raise the royalties paid at the time the combination
was formed for the use of the various machines, and it
has never done so. It proposed also to take off what had been
a custom in the business—the initial charges for installing
machines. Indeed, the company claims that while before
the combination the initial charge for fitting out a factory was
$12,000, it now is but $1700. In the case of many of the
metallic machines, as they are called, the practice was to
charge no rent, but to require the manufacturer to take from
the companies certain findings, like tacks, wire nails, and eyelets;
the company charged its own price, not the current one,
and in this way got its pay. These prices probably were
always high, but the company claims it has never raised them.
That is, the new organization proposed to make no changes
in what the manufacturer had been paying, but to increase
its profits through the greater continuity and perfection of
the service of its system.</p>

<p class='c007'>But this of course meant that the manufacturer should use
all the machines in its system; that is, all those that it had
tied together. And to make sure that he did this, the company
prepared a remarkable lease, requiring that all the
machines it made pertaining to the bottoming of shoes beginning
with the lasting of the uppers should be kept together;
that is, that no outside machines for any of these processes
could be used, and if an attempt was made to introduce one,
the company had the right to take out the remaining machines
of the system.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to the regular bottoming and lasting machinery
the company handled a large number of general machines,
and it was specifically provided in the leases of each of these
that it should not be used on shoes that had been lasted and
welt-stitched, or turn-stitched on other machines than those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>put out by the company. The penalty for using the leased
machine with outside machines was the forfeiture of all leases
in all departments—also the breach made the lessees liable
to an action for damages.</p>

<p class='c007'>The New England Shoe and Leather Association considered
certain features of the leases for the metallic fastening
machines so objectionable that a long series of conferences
was held in 1901 with the company, and certain modifications
were obtained. Thus an alternative was secured for the ironclad
lease covering the metallic fasteners by which the shoe
manufacturer could use them with foreign machines by paying
ten per cent more for his materials. (The rent of these
machines, it will be remembered, was included in the price
charged for the materials.) The penalty for disobedience was
also lightened, and other concessions were obtained. Thus
it is possible now to buy the general machines outright. The
committee said quite frankly in its report that it was clear
that the company intended to make such contracts as would
give it a monopoly of the manufacture and renting of all shoe
machinery, but it added it was patent that to do this it must
continue to serve the shoe manufacturers better than they
could be served elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c007'>The monopoly the committee foresaw was of course inevitable.
To-day the United Shoe Machinery Company
owns more than ninety per cent of the shoe machinery of the
country. Its profits are enormous, as the expansion noted
above shows. The royalty on a pair of woman’s shoes is
about three cents. On a pair of man’s shoes it is from four
to five cents. In a factory turning out a thousand pairs a day
of the former there is a royalty of $30.00 a day. The writer
has talked with one shoe manufacturer who claimed he had
paid $165,000 a year in royalties to the trust and upward of
$100,000 for materials. Many would-be independent manufacturers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>claim they could reduce the cost of manufacture
two cents a pair if allowed to own their machines. It is a
common assertion among them that the royalties for the first
year pay a reasonable price for the machines; that as the life
of a machine is ten years, there are nine years of “unholy
profits to the trust!” While discontent at the “benevolent
despotism” which rules the business breaks out all over the
country in spots, and a few energetic attempts are working to
build up independent systems, the shoe manufacturers as a
body have accepted the combination. Certainly they are
getting from it such a service as they never had before, whatever
the oppression. The shoe manufacturer can by the use
of the “system” increase his product and the piece-paid
laborer his wages. At the same time without raising royalties
the company profits enormously. The person who gets no
advantage is the man who buys the shoes. The royalty paid
on each pair is just what it was when the trust was formed.</p>

<p class='c007'>And what has the United Shoe Machinery Company to
do with the Linen Thread Company? The president and
the vice-president of the latter, Mr. William Barbour and
Mr. A. R. Turner, are both directors in the former. Mr.
Barbour, who is reputed to be the largest owner of the
linen thread stock, is also a large individual stock-holder of
United Shoe Machinery. Can any one doubt that such a relation
has not been of importance to the Linen Thread Company
in securing the 80 per cent of the linen thread business which
it controls? Or would it be surprising, the power, the protection,
and the surpluses of the two being given, if there soon
was nobody outside of their fold making either linen thread
or shoe machinery?</p>

<p class='c007'>Moreover, is not the logical and almost inevitable result of
the practical monopoly of these two interwoven concerns the
rapid absorption of the shoe manufacturers themselves?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>Why, when they own and control all machinery and linen
thread, and furnish a rapidly increasing list of the findings,
should they stop there? Does not the strategy of the situation,
do not the same arguments, the same laws which have
led to the monopoly of each and the alliance of the two, force
them into shoe manufacturing? This is no new alarm. In
1901, when the New England Shoe and Leather Association
made the report referred to above, it said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The fear has been expressed that should one company
control all the machinery in use in the production of shoes it
would be quite easy and enormously profitable to create a
trust which would be a monopoly in the shoe manufacturing
business. The committee has not discovered the remotest
indication of such intention. The present managers of the
United Shoe Machinery Company are unusually able, experienced
men, and they know that their profits are to come
from coöperation with shoe manufacturers rather than competition
with them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>That was true of the profits then; it is true now, but with
recalcitrant manufacturers refusing to coöperate—wanting
to work out their own salvation—and with funds piling up
for expansion, the “good of the shoe business,” which led to
the first monopoly, will probably some day point strongly to
a second.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is but one force to hinder the final absorption of the
shoe business by the combinations we have been considering,
and it must be admitted that this is a powerful one—there
is a rival trust with as rapacious a maw and as brutal a
strength as any the country has produced on the trail of the
shoe—that is the Beef Trust.</p>

<p class='c007'>Twenty years ago when the amiable Mr. McKinley was
disposed to give the duty on hides, Mr. Blaine wrote him,
“<i>It will yield a profit to the butcher (Beef Trust) only, the last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>man that needs it.</i>” Mr. Blaine prevented the duty then—but
Mr. Dingley gave it, and certainly the Beef Trust has
profited as much as the shoe has suffered.</p>

<p class='c007'>But while the cost of the leather steadily increased under
the duty on hides, there was going on in the Beef Trust the
inevitable combination which special privileges breed. Buying
practically all the cattle on the hoof, the packers owned
all the hides. Hides go to tanners to be prepared for sole
leather. It has always been a prosperous and widely spread
business in the country. But the dream of the Beef Trust
is to allow nobody to do anything directly or indirectly connected
with the steer which it can do. It owned the hides;
why should it not tan them? And promptly it began to
“acquire” tanneries. There is no space here to go into the
history of the steady absorption by the packers of this great
American industry which has been going on in the last few
years. All that is essential here is the fact that to-day the
united packers, Armour, Swift, and Morris control fully thirty
of the largest tanneries in the country. And the next step?
Signs of what it will be are already abroad. Repeated
rumors have come that the Armours were going into the shoe
business. In the reports of the tariff hearings of 1908–1909,
is a letter from the president of the Wholesale Saddlery Association
of the United States protesting against the duty on
hides. In this letter he writes:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The statement that follows may appear to you very far
fetched, but it is my confident personal opinion that if the
condition which confronts leather manufacturers and the
manufacturers of leather articles continues and advances with
the same strides during the next ten years that it has during
the past five, not only will the beef packers control the manufacture
of the leather, but they will likewise <i>control by ownership
the shoe, harness, belting, and other leather industries</i>.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>And this is only one of the several such intimations to be found
in the reports. There is nothing surprising in it. That the
packers should absorb the manufacturing from leather is quite
as logical as that they should make leather. It was these
facts and possibilities that forced the duty off hides in the
Payne-Aldrich Bill, but it was only accomplished after a
fight of the most unusual character.</p>

<p class='c007'>The duty on thread was lowered in 1909, but there is no
rational interpretation of the doctrine of protection which
can defend that which it still carries. All that the suppliants
pretend to ask is enough to cover the difference in wage
cost here and abroad—enough to defend Mr. Barbour in
the United States from Mr. Barbour in Ireland! According
to the calculations of a practical independent thread man
doing business in both countries, the actual difference in 1909
in the cost of production in Ireland and the United States in
well-managed factories was not over six cents a pound. But
the Payne Bill fixes the protection of the three linen threads
most used in shoe-making at 15½ cents, 18¾ cents, and 20
cents. It is doubtful that this reduction is sufficient, now
that the linen thread maker gets his raw material free, to
produce any effect at all on the price to the trade. The duty
is still grotesquely prohibitive.</p>

<p class='c007'>When one goes over less important but still essential articles
of the household, he finds numbers of them where the
price advanced in the first decade after the Dingley Bill
through a tariff-supported trust. Take the item of starch.
From whatever product made it carried under the bill of 1897
a duty of 1½ cents a pound. Starch and its related products
made from corn are now largely controlled by the Glucose
Trust, as it is called—the Corn Products Company. The
Glucose Trust is popularly known as a Standard Oil concern.
That company has, to be sure, issued “A Protest and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>Warning” against the association of the name of the two
concerns. But so long as the headquarters of the Corn Products
Company are 26 Broadway, its president a director of
the Standard Oil Company and four of its directors on the
Board of Directors of the Standard Oil Company, the protest
and warning will have little influence on a cynical public.
In a statement presented at the recent tariff hearings a complainant
said that since the formation of the Glucose Trust
in 1902, in spite of many improvements, chemical and mechanical,
corn starch which for years had sold at $1.00 to $1.50 per
100 pounds in New York sold in car-load lots at $2.65 per
100 pounds! Without the tariff, this combination could not
last a day for both England and Germany could compete
with them. Not only compete in price, but outstrip them in
quality, for naturally enough concerns like the Glucose Trust
controlling a market are indifferent to quality. Quality is
a thing which men are driven to by the fear of a rival taking
their market. Take this fear away and you get inferior
goods—that is, the poor are not only obliged under the protective
tariff to <i>pay</i> more, but to <i>buy</i> more. Our potato
starch factories also do not pretend to compete in quality
with the German concerns in spite of the higher prices they
get. They are not obliged to make the best goods. Their
market is secure without it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tin plate is another household necessity of which the price
was sharply advanced after the Dingley Bill and the formation
of the tin plate trust. Domestic tin plate which was
sold for $3.43 per 100 pounds in 1896, sold in 1900, under the
Dingley tariff, for $4.67. While in 1906 we were paying
$3.86 for our tin plate in New York, the Englishman was getting
his about a dollar cheaper. The Englishman and the
Standard Oil Company! The Standard Oil Company has
been, for many years, probably the largest single consumer of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>tin plate in the country—practically all of the oil it sends to
the Orient being put into tin cans which it manufactures itself
from imported plate. One of the many curious features of our
tariff laws is the system of drawbacks by which the duty on
imported materials made into goods for export is rebated.
These rebates or drawbacks are paid on many things, but the
amount is insignificant excepting in two or three cases. Out
of drawbacks aggregating something like five and a quarter
millions in 1900 and five and three-quarters in 1906 by far the
largest item was tin plate—$1,848,792 in the former year,
$2,252,381.82 in the latter. That is, the man who in 1906
manufactured tin cans to sell to his countrymen paid about
20 per cent more for his material than the Standard Oil
Company paid for what it manufactured to sell to the foreigner.
Of course the home consumer of tin pails and milk
pans paid the higher cost. As a result of taxing ourselves
we have a tin plate industry in the United States. In 1900,
as a result of the high prices of the decade preceding, 57 tin
plate establishments had grown up where ten years before
there were none. These 57 establishments employed about
4000 people and turned out nearly $32,000,000 worth of goods.
In 1905 the industry had grown to a product of something
over $35,000,000, and employed about 5000 people. In order
to build up this industry, secure this product, provide places
for these workmen, it has been estimated that we taxed ourselves
between 1890 and 1900 fully $90,000,000. Taxed ourselves
$90,000,000 and let off our largest single consumer
scot free. We also have been selling abroad the tin plate we
manufacture here at considerably less price than at home.
And now observe how in the case of tin plate the protected
American manufacturer gets even on this lower price to the
foreigner. He takes it out of the laborer—<i>that is the wages
of tin plate workers are reduced 25 per cent on tin plate made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>for export</i>. The Standard Oil trust gets its duties rebated
on export work and the tin plate workers get their wages cut!</p>

<p class='c007'>The contrast in results to the consumer between putting
on and taking off a duty are strikingly illustrated by a comparison
of the tin plate experiment with the quinine experiment.
In 1879 the duty of 40 per cent on this favorite American
medicine was removed by a special act of Congress. The
extortion practised under the duty had been outrageous,
quinine selling in 1878 as high as $4.75 an ounce. Five years
after the quinine bill passed the price had fallen to $1.23 an
ounce, ten years after to 35 cents, and in 1906 to 16½ cents!
Far from destroying the quinine industry in this country as
the manufacturer tearfully declared it would, the business
goes on prosperously. Whether gains or losses come to the
manufacturer the people share with him. He cannot gobble
the lion’s share of the one or shift the lion’s share of the other
as the thread and starch and tin plate and dozens of other
manufacturers can.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where prices increase faster than incomes, as they did with
the great majority in the period we have under consideration,
one of two things must happen,—the amount and quality
of necessaries are cut, or substitutes are found. Both have
happened in a rather startling way in the last twenty years in
one of the materials most essential to human health and
comfort, woollens. Wool, the world over, has always been
accepted as the poor man’s special friend. It protects
against cold and damp. It wears well; it looks well. The
tradition of woollen garments as a lasting household possession,
one of the things which belongs to the outfit of even the
humblest, is very strong in every country. “All wool” is
the housewife’s boast of her blankets and shawl, the young
girl of her winter coat and gown, the laborer of his shirt. It
is the assurance on which salesmen depend for winning customers.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>It is a standard material of clothing as general and
as necessary in our climate as wheat is an article of food.
But for twenty years this valuable standard material has
been every day receding farther from the reach of the great
mass of Americans. Many housewives the country over
have ceased buying woollen blankets, substituting the cotton-filled
puff or “comfort.” Settlement workers and district
nurses say that they rarely see a woollen blanket in the houses
they visit. Knit cotton undergarments and heavy knit
cotton stockings are generally substituted for wool. Many
thousands know they cannot think of wool, and dismiss the
idea. But so strong is the tradition of wool among the
people of cool climates, among Russians, Germans, etc., that
a salesman in the shops of the tenement house district declares
his slimsiest imitations “all wool.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A curious person can easily satisfy himself as to the quality
of these “all wool” garments by boiling them in caustic
alkali. The experiment is very simple and quite conclusive
of the amount of wool in the article. If it is “all wool” the
alkali makes short work of it, no residue is left after the
boiling. Silk will also disappear. Cotton is untouched.
Take a baby’s shirt for which you pay 50 cents with the
solemn assurance that it is “every stitch wool.” It is well-shaped,
finished with a neat shell edge apparently of silk, a
ribbon down the front for the buttons, three rows of “silk”
stitching around the sleeves. Cut the garment into two
pieces and boil one for twenty minutes in a strong solution of
alkali. The pieces treated compare now very favorably,
fleecy lining shell edge and all, with the piece untouched.
The ribbon alone has disappeared. There is not a thread of
wool in it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Try another experiment with a girl’s sleeveless vest for
wearing over the gown under the coat. This garment will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>cost $1.25 in an East Side shop. It feels like wool and is
sold for wool, but it comes out of the pot intact, a strong,
durable cotton yarn vest which could have had but a small
fraction of wool in it in the first place if, indeed, it had any.
Its real worth is not over 25 cents.</p>

<p class='c007'>This same experiment will show similar adulteration in
many of the blankets and much of the dress goods and suitings
sold to the unknowing as all wool. Vast quantities of
so-called “cotton worsteds” are manufactured annually.
The amount of wool in these goods has been steadily decreasing
in the last few years, falling from 50 per cent to 25 per
cent, and from there to practically all cotton, immense quantities
of the last being manufactured for boys’ and men’s
wear. It is from cotton worsteds and cheap shoddies that the
$8.00 and $10.00 suits for women, the $10.00 and $12.00 suits
for men, are generally made. The goods may be sold by the
manufacturer for what they are, but at the counter the purchaser
receives the express or implied assurance that they are
all wool. To such lengths has the adulteration gone that it
may be laid down as a fact that people on small incomes
to-day rarely if ever wear anything but cotton and shoddy
mixtures.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, that things have changed is not proof that they are
worse. Because a great number of us in the United States
cannot get the woollen blankets, shawls, and clothes which we
once had and which are still accessible at low prices to the
European laborer and peasant is not proof that we have not
a better substitute. May it not be that woollen garments,
blankets, and suits are a superstition? Are we not just as
well off clothed in cotton substitutes?</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no doubt cotton knit goods are admirably cheap
underclothing, most of them are well fitting, and some of them
are durable. Where light clothing is sufficient—and with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>the general heating of houses, factories, and shops and cars,
there is no longer the same need, for many people, of heavy
clothing as in the old days—they are adequate. There is
no doubt the young girl’s cotton worsted gown looks well at
the start. The cotton warp “all wool” suit of the laboring
man has a correct finish, color, and style, better perhaps than
of old, for finish and cut are demanded by the poorest and
are achieved remarkably by the cheapest clothiers. But in
two particulars the cotton substitute fails. It has not the
warmth, and it does not keep its appearance. True, if a man
puts on enough cotton garments he can get the same warmth.
But he cannot get from cotton the same protection against
storm and wet, the same safeguard where his labor subjects
him to excessive perspiration. He cannot get the same comfort
at night. Moreover, his garment becomes shabby,
loses its shape, in much shorter time. Women can no longer
make over with satisfaction the gowns they once wore a series
of winters. The man’s suit is no longer respectable as “long
as it holds together.” Those of us who must buy cheap
clothes can find them at the long established popular prices,
but we no longer get the warmth or the satisfaction from
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the discussion of the Payne-Aldrich tariff bill,
evidence enough of this was laid before Congress. Mr.
Nicholas Longworth, for instance, read to the Committee on
Ways and Means a letter from a clothier in his congressional
bailiwick in which the man declared: “<i>I never handled
cloth of so inferior a quality as I do now. Laborers, mechanics,
and farmers who use ready-made clothing are receiving practically
no value for their money.</i>” The National Association of
Clothiers were strong in their protest to Congress. “Standard
winter worsteds,” their committee said, “which twelve
years ago ranged from twenty-one to twenty-four ounces in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>weight per yard, have gradually been decreased in weight, so
that they now range from fourteen to sixteen ounces per yard;
standard spring worsteds which ranged from fourteen to sixteen
ounces in weight per yard have gradually been decreased,
so that they now range from nine to twelve ounces per yard.
In consequence, a deterioration of fully thirty-three and one-third
per cent in weight has taken place, in addition to the
establishment of a much higher range of prices for the same
qualities of goods. The clothing manufacturer, therefore,
through the inability of the cloth to stand ordinary wear,
is largely deprived of the opportunity to produce garments
upon which a good reputation can be based.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But why should the materials which are used in our cheap
clothing be unsatisfactory—why can we not get durable
cheap goods, as it is certain we once could? The answer is
not contained in a word. There is always more than one
reason for sweeping changes in standard articles like woollen
goods. However, the chief reason, the one which is more
powerful than all the rest, is to be found in the complicated
wool schedule which has been in operation in this country
since 1867, the three years of the Wilson tariff excepted.
This schedule rests upon two arbitrary and utterly unjust
duties. The first of these is that on wool “in the grease,”
as wool is called when it is sheared from the sheep. To prepare
this wool for manufacturing it is first scoured until clean,
an operation which causes a shrinkage of from twenty to
eighty per cent in the weight of the wool. In turning this
clean wool into cloth there is a still further shrinkage. Indeed,
the total shrinkage from wool to cloth is such that it sometimes
requires as much as five or six pounds to make a pound
of cloth; and again it requires as little as two pounds. Of
course the value of the wool varies according to the shrinkage,
<i>i.e.</i> according to the amount of cloth a manufacturer can get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>from a given lot. It also varies according to the <i>kind</i> of
cloth the wool will make, <i>i.e.</i> whether it will make a fine or
coarse cloth. Now all imported “grease wool,” suited for
clothing regardless of its value, of the amount of dirt and
grease there is in it, the amount it shrinks, the amount and
quality of cloth you can get from it, has to pay a duty of
eleven or twelve cents a pound. If the American wool-growers
who secured this duty, to begin with, on the supposition
that they would soon be able to produce enough wool to
supply the home demand had been able to keep their promises,
it would not have been necessary to import wool, and
competition might have kept the home prices down. But the
wool-growers have not for many years, if ever, produced
even half of what we use. It is customary to figure the
amount as much larger. “Seventy per cent of the wool we
use is produced at home,” the wool boomers cry, but they do
their figuring on grease wool and omit altogether the wool
which comes in manufactured! There is only one fair way
to estimate the amount we grow, and that is to find out what
we get from it after it is cleaned of grease and dirt and compare
it with the clean wool, raw and manufactured, we import.
Do this and we find that we really produce nearer 40 per cent
than 70 per cent of what we use. In 1890—in 1895—in
1900—this was the approximate proportion. One of the
leading wool authorities of the country makes the relative
proportion the same in 1906, <i>i.e.</i> 40 per cent domestic to 60
per cent foreign. For 1909, he figured it 37 per cent domestic
to 63 per cent foreign.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, as said above, all of the wool imported must pay a
duty of eleven or twelve cents a pound when it is “in the
grease.” The American wool-grower in normal and prosperous
times can charge more for his wool because of this
duty. He may not be able to add the full amount to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>price—in fact, it is probable that he rarely does, but he certainly
gets considerably more than he could if he were not
protected.</p>

<p class='c007'>The way the duty works is clearly illustrated by a personal
experience in wool-buying related by Robert Bleakie, of
Boston, a manufacturer who has been making woollen goods
in this country <i>continuously</i> since 1848. Mr. Bleakie’s account
is of a purchase of wool he made in 1897 just before the
Dingley Bill went into effect, that is, when we had free wool.
He had bought in Africa 223,684 pounds of wool at 9<span class='fraction'>9<br /><span class='vincula'>10</span></span> cents
a pound. By the time he got it to Boston it cost him 13<span class='fraction'>2<br /><span class='vincula'>10</span></span>
cents a pound ($29,565.83 for the lot). Now, let us suppose
Mr. Bleakie’s wool had not reached Boston until <i>after</i> the
Dingley Bill had gone into effect, that is, until after the eleven
cents a pound had been placed on grease wool. To get his
wool out of the custom-house Mr. Bleakie would have had to
pay the tidy sum of $24,605.22; <i>i.e.</i> eleven cents on each
pound. This would have made the wool cost him, instead of
twenty-nine thousand dollars, over fifty-four thousand
dollars. But it was fine wool, shrinking heavily in cleaning.
As a matter of fact, he got out of the 223,684 pounds he imported
only 85,000 pounds which he could use. But note
that he would have had to pay duty on the <i>entire</i> lot, that is,
to pay it on 138,684 pounds of grease and dirt as well as on
the 85,000 pounds of clean wool! Of course the duty simply
shut him off from importing heavy-shrinking wool, and at
the same time made domestic wool of this kind too dear to
buy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, there are two classes of wool manufacturers, known as
carded woollen and worsted. The former, to which class Mr.
Bleakie belongs, finds a large proportion of the wool they need
to be heavy-shrinking—the latter use mainly the light-shrinking
wool. It is the carded woollen manufacturer who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>makes our heavy woollen clothes—flannels and blankets,
the warm and durable “all wool” goods of the poor man.
Mr. Bleakie’s experience just quoted shows what the eleven-cent
duty on grease wool does to his business. It takes the
raw material away from it—“starves” it, as the manufacturers
say. At the same time it gives his competitor—the
worsted maker—a decisive advantage, for he uses mainly
light-shrinking wool. It is obvious that if two manufacturers
each import one hundred pounds of wool in the grease,
and each pay $11.00 duty on his lot, the one which gets the
larger number of pounds of clean wool will have the other
at a disadvantage. Yet each will pay the same duty, $11.00
on a hundred-pound lot.</p>

<p class='c007'>What this discrimination against those who use the heavy-shrinking
wool amounts to is making wool too dear to be put
into the common grades of flannels, blankets, and clothing
materials. The manufacturer is forced to find substitutes.
Forty-four years ago, when the duties on the coarse grades
of wool were first made prohibitive, and the manufacturers
were forced to find substitutes in order to make clothes that
the average man could afford to buy, wool rags, wool waste,
and carpet wools were resorted to. They were wool, at least,
and warm. Between 1867 and 1890 the annual importation
of shoddy rose from about 500,000 to 9,000,000 pounds.
Then the cry went up that it was displacing wool. Prohibitive
duties were placed upon all kinds of wool substitutes.
By 1890 duties so high were put on all the wool substitutes
that they could not be imported; that is, after taxing wool
off our backs—the wool substitutes were taken away.
Deprived of the advantages which the inventions for using
waste gave, there was nothing left but cotton for the bulk of
the substitutes used in inexpensive goods, and cotton it has
been ever since. The rapid absorption by cotton of the wool
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>field has indeed been one of the most significant changes in
American industry since the McKinley Bill of 1890. The
tables of 1905 show that while from 1890 to 1905 cotton
increased in the manufacturing of clothing materials about
100 per cent, wool increased only about 25 per cent. One
whole department of manufacturing formerly classed under
wool, is now placed with cotton hosiery and knit underwear.
The decrease in the per capita consumption of wool shows
still more strikingly the passing of wool. In 1890 we were
consuming 8.75 pounds apiece; in 1904, 6.22 pounds,—<i>less</i>
than we used in 1860!</p>

<p class='c007'>This astonishing change in the relative use of the two
materials is not all due to the tariff on raw wool. Cotton is
gaining the world over. The general tendency to lighter
clothing, the demand for a larger number of garments, and
so cheaper prices, the failure of the world’s wool production
to increase and consequently its higher price—all have
encouraged the change, but it is certain that the great determining
factor in the United States had been this duty combined
with a second mischief-maker—the ratio used in
estimating the compensatory duty on all products of wool
imported.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the maker of woollens had a sufficient supply of free wool—that
is, if the price of his raw material was not raised by
a duty—all the protection he could rightfully ask against
his foreign rival would be the difference in the cost of production
here and abroad. But his wool costs him more than
his foreign rival’s. If he is to meet him on a level, he must be
protected against wool as well as production; that is, there
must be two duties on cloth which is imported—one a duty
to make up for the higher price he has had to pay for his raw
material, the other for the higher price of manufacturing.</p>

<p class='c007'>These two duties vary with different grades of woollens.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>The schedule is highly complex—a matter for experts only.
Its results, however, are simple—and hard—enough, for
what they amount to is that the cheaper the blanket or the
dress goods, the <span class='fss'>HIGHER</span> the duty! On many materials and
articles suitable for the slender purse these duties are so high
that none of the goods can be imported. On cloth, for instance,
worth not more than forty cents a pound, the duty
averages over 140 per cent; on cloth worth more than seventy
cents a pound, it averages about 95 per cent.</p>

<p class='c007'>We shall notice here but one item of the taxes which bring
about this unjust discrimination, and that is the duty allowed
to make up for the higher cost of the raw wool. This duty
is reckoned on the number of pounds of wool in the grease
supposed to be used in making a pound of cloth. Where the
goods are worth less than forty cents a pound three pounds
are allowed; where they are worth more, four pounds. As
the duty on this wool is eleven cents, the compensatory duty
on a pound of cloth is thirty-three or forty-four cents. Take
the latter as an illustration, it applying to the only grades
imported in any quantity. This is an out and out swindle, for
the simple reason that few of them contain this amount of
grease wool.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the discussion of the wool schedule was going on in
Congress in 1909, the <cite>Textile World Record</cite>, a remarkably
able, and fair-minded Boston trade journal, published the
result of a series of analyses of cloth which its editor, Samuel
S. Dale, had made personally, in order to discover the actual
protection each was getting under the Dingley law. The
estimate in each case was based on a large quantity, 10,000
yards. Here are samples of the results. The first fabric
was a worsted serge, weighing 11,500 pounds. Mr. Dale
found that 21,941 pounds of grease wool had been used in this
piece of cloth. Now, according to a rational and honest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>application of the protective principle, one would expect
the compensatory duty, in case such a piece of cloth was
presented for import, to be eleven cents on each 21,941 pounds,
or $2413.51; but as a matter of fact, it would be $5060!
That is, forty-four cents would be charged on each pound of
cloth; as if four pounds of wool had been required to make
it, while as a matter of fact, less than two pounds had gone
into it.</p>

<p class='c007'>A cotton-warp dress goods was analyzed in which but a
trifle over one pound of grease wool had been used for each
pound of cloth. Mr. Dale calculated the compensatory
duty on the 10,000 yards should be $496.65. But that cloth
actually receives $2595.63! In the case of a piece of cotton
warp casket cloth made of cotton, wool, and shoddy, the compensatory
duty under the law is reckoned at $4262.72, while
actually it should be $2238.15, and so it went. But two of
the eleven fabrics contained over half of the four pounds on
which the duty would be reckoned.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to the compensatory duty of forty-four cents
is the duty to protect from difference in the cost of production,
which is 50 or 55 per cent of the value of the cloth. There
is probably no doubt but this duty is all out of proportion to
the actual difference. Forty-four years ago, when practically
the same duties now in force on wool were wrested from an
unwilling Congress by a combination of wool-growers and
woollen manufacturers, all that the latter asked was 25 per
cent to cover difference in the cost of production. American
labor has advanced, but so has European labor—and still
more has machinery increased the output.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course these high duties make imported cloth very expensive,
and enable American manufacturers to hold up their
prices. As a matter of fact, the duty makes the American
consumer of woollen goods pay just about double what his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>English cousin pays. In 1908 I was shown by a gentleman
who has for years been at the head of one of the best of the
wholesale cloth houses of New York, a bundle of matched
samples of woollen goods—American and English—with
carefully worked out statements of cost here and abroad.
The goods had been matched by one of the leading woollen
experts of England. I was unable to detect any difference in
quality, and only the slightest in finish. There was practically
no choice, so slight was the difference. But note the
price. For an American serge costing $1.37½ a yard the
price of the matched English goods in Bradford was 67 cents.
The English equivalent of an American fabric costing $1.50
was 78.05 cents. Beautiful blue light-weight serges, such as
are used for men’s summer suits, cost in America $1.80, in
Bradford 81.2 cents. The mohair which is used so much in
this country for women’s summer travelling suits can be
bought in Bradford for 27¼ cents; here it is wholesaled at 70
cents and costs at retail $1.00. This was the showing over a
large range of goods. It amounted to this, that the English
price was only about half the American.</p>

<p class='c007'>An example of the difference in cost of woollen goods was
given in 1909 in Boston, where the cost of living was being
investigated. Mr. Dale, of the <cite>Textile World Record</cite>, was
being questioned on the comparative costs of American and
European goods. “You can make comparisons in two
ways,” Mr. Dale answered; “first, by comparing prices at
which the same grades are sold, and, second, by comparing
the grades that are sold at the same price. For example,
here are two fabrics, one made and sold in this country, and
the other made and sold in England. The English fabric is
sold at 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> (84 cents) a yard, 55 inches wide. The American
cloth is sold for 77½ cents per yard, 55 inches wide. So
that the two are sold at approximately the same price. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>difference is represented by the difference in the two fabrics.
The English cloth is a fine worsted weighing 10¼ ounces per
yard, 55 inches wide; the American fabric is made with a
cotton warp and a mixed cotton and wool filling. The cloth
consists of 30 per cent wool, 70 per cent cotton. It weighs
9.6 ounces per yard, 55 inches wide.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to this increase in prices, a most exasperating
practice developed after the passage of the Dingley Bill in
many protected industries—selling goods abroad at prices
from 10 to 70 per cent lower than they were sold at home.
The Dingley Bill had not been long in operation before the
administration itself warned the iron and steel people officially
that they were in danger of giving the game away if they
continued to sell steel rails, for months together, to foreigners
for $22.00 a ton, while they charged their compatriots
$35.00. But the warning seems to have had little effect. Frank
manufacturers like Mr. Schwab said, Of course we sell cheaper
to foreigners; not only that, but we sell materials to our
fellow manufacturers cheaper when they are to be turned
into goods for foreigners than we do when they are to be turned
into goods for our own people! Mr. McKinley’s Industrial
Commission of 1900 found considerable evidence of discriminating
export prices. The contention of the corporations
which admitted the practice was that it was necessary to
work off surplus, and to keep factories going on full time.
Mr. Thomas W. Phillips of the Commission, in commenting
on this explanation in a minority report, said, “This argument
overlooks the fact that their surplus product could also be
worked off by lower prices at home, and that it is the tariff
which encourages them to create a domestic surplus by
restricting domestic consumption through high prices.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The best detailed evidence of the difference between home
and foreign prices which we have, comes in the price lists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>which are prepared for foreign trade-lists, which are not circulated
in this country, of course. In 1906 the Tariff Reform
Committee of New York City issued a pamphlet made up
from discount sheets by Byron W. Holt. It is a beautiful
study in gratitude! Mr. Holt names over 250 different articles
on which at that date discounts of from 10 to 66 per cent
lower were quoted to foreign than to home buyers! An
American dealer paid $5.50 for potato hoes which a foreigner
could get for $4.75. All farm tools, indeed, were sold
abroad far lower than at home, thanks to the Farm Tools
Trust. He paid $16.00 a dozen for wooden wheelbarrows for
which the foreigner paid $14.50. He paid $20.00 for the incubator
which to the dealer over the border was quoted at $15.00.
He paid $30.24 per gross for soap which the foreign dealer
bought for $20.48, and so one might go on with scores of
articles of daily use in farming, in housekeeping, in all sorts
of trades. In 1909 the same committee published a similar
exhibit showing that equal advantages were still regularly
offered on a great variety of articles. It sometimes seems as
if the great American system for making the foreigner pay
the duty had resulted in presenting it to the foreigner. He
buys our goods cheaper than we can buy them, and, like Mr.
Coats, establishes his factory here, and, protected from world
competition, drives our own manufacturers into his combination,
runs the business from the other side of the waters, and
charges us twice as much as he can his countrymen!</p>

<p class='c007'>The protected manufacturer does not always export at a
discount. Very often he follows Mr. Coats’s lead and establishes
himself abroad. He finds it more advantageous to do
this because in most civilized lands the materials of industry
are free. Many years ago the duty on nickel drove the
Meriden Britannia Company to build in Canada and there
they still manufacture for export. In 1906 Mr. James J. Hill,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>commenting on the rapid multiplication of American industrial
plants in Canada, said: “A few years ago there was not
a smelter on Canadian soil west of the Rocky Mountains.
To-day there are six in British Columbia and these are largely
occupied with the reduction of American ores. Commerce
will go her own way even though she must walk in leg irons.”
Curious and unnatural alliances have already begun to arise
from this effort of industry to escape her leg irons. Take
the case of the International Harvester Company, which has
been much abused, and unjustly, for selling abroad at prices
lower than at home. Whatever may have been its practice
in earlier years, it has been well established by the recent investigation
of a government agent that the prices of its
machines are <i>lower</i> in this country than they are abroad. The
reason seems to be a rather nice little combination of tariffs
and price fixing. For instance, the binder which in the United
States sells for $125.00 at retail sells in France for $173.70.
The reapers, mowers, and rakes are proportionately dearer.
There are two reasons for this: In the first place France has
been applying her maximum tariff to our exports, by way
of meeting our high duties on her products. But after the
harvesting machines get into the country, they meet another
hindrance to a natural price; the importers of agricultural
machines in France are organized into a general syndicate,
which consists of French, German, Canadian, and American
firms. These gentlemen have combined to prevent price
cutting. Judging by the comparative prices of the machines
here and in France, they have succeeded admirably. The
Americans, in spite of the large advance they get on their
goods, have not been satisfied, and the International Harvester
Company has erected factories at Croix. If the
reciprocity agreement with France negotiated in 1898 had
been put into effect, the company claims that it would not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>have taken this slice of its capital and product out of this
country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again, it is the tariff which has induced this same company
to construct factories in Canada, Sweden, Germany, and
Russia. In Germany, the binders which they sell here for
$125.00 are selling, according to consular reports, for $203.00.
The German tariff on a binder of this kind is about $12.00. It
would seem that the company ought to be able to manufacture
in the United States, pay this duty, and still make good
profits on the $125.00 binder. If tariffs did not have the tendency
to increase rather than decrease, this might be so.
Experience seems to prove that where tariff exists the manufacturer
is safer on the <i>inside</i> of the wall, even though it may
be that it costs him as much or more to manufacture there
than it does at home. The Harvester claims that <i>in spite of
the difference of wages, it has no hope of being able to manufacture
more cheaply abroad than at home</i>. This is no doubt due to
a factor which protectionists unite in ignoring,—the greater
productivity of the American workman.</p>

<p class='c007'>The whole situation is an excellent example of the unnatural
and uncertain relations into which tariffs thrust
industry. Moreover, it is an illustration of the way tariffs
in the long run defeat their own purpose. The International
Harvester Company did a business of $90,000,000 in 1910,
<i>over one-third</i> of which was <i>outside</i> of the United States. Its
future depends largely on the development of this outside
market, and tariff conditions are such, thanks mainly to our
own policy, that they find it advantageous to establish factories
in the very countries which are our best customers!</p>

<p class='c007'>With each year that passed after the Dingley Bill became
a law, the burden of increased prices became heavier, the
restraint on commerce more unendurable. There were other
causes at work besides prohibitive duties, but in certain cases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>these very causes could be weakened by revising the tariff.
It was an obvious way of easing a bad situation, though by no
means a cure-all. Through the whole citizen mass irritation
at the reluctance of politicians to touch the subject, existed,
and with time found varied expression. Unfortunately the
leader of neither party had ever really sensed the enormity
of the protective system, and consequently he could not sense
the strength of the revolt which had begun. Neither Mr.
Bryan nor Mr. Roosevelt had ever found in the tariff a sufficient
cause of the evils they attacked so valiantly to arouse
their indignation. Neither of them had ever been genuinely
stirred by the unsoundness of the doctrine or by the vicious
practices for which it was responsible, or by the heavy burdens
it laid “where every penny counts.” By all the signs
Theodore Roosevelt should have been the Richard Cobden
of our tariff reform, but he did not see it as a dragon worthy
of his steel.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the issue was there deep in men’s minds; something
oppressive, puzzling, and complicated, but not to be avoided
for that reason. So strong and genuine was this popular
conviction that the Republican party was forced in 1908 to
declare for a downward revision of the tariff, and because of
that declaration chiefly, it was able to elect its candidate
for the presidency, William H. Taft.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <span class='large'>THE MAKING OF THE BILL OF 1909</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>No one can study the drift of public opinion in each of the
great agitations of the tariff question in the last fifty years
without realizing that at least nine-tenths of the people have
stood only for such duties as would produce needed revenue
and would give industries which were trying to prove their
ability to exist in the United States, protection through a
limited period. But when it came to the point the people
have never had such duties. To those familiar with the
methods of tariff-making which have prevailed over this half-century,
it was obvious that the bill of 1909 would result as
had the bills of 1883, of 1890, of 1894, and of 1897. There
were optimists who said that this could not be. This time
the “voice of the people” was too clear, this time the game
was too apparent. But the game was no more clear and “the
voice of the people” no louder than in other years. The
preparatory work for the bill was preceded as always by long
months of “Hearings.” The absurdity of this method of
seeking facts on which to frame a bill would be obvious enough
if the country had not grown so accustomed to it. The reports
published of the hearings before the Ways and Means
Committee for the last bill cover something over 8725 pages.
It is unbelievable that any serious body of men would consent
to sit day after day to listen to such a conglomeration of
narrow and selfish notions of what the witnesses’ personal
enterprises need to help them along—much less consent to
print them at public expense. White-haired men came to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>repeat the pleas that we heard in war times—sons repeated
the jargon they had learned from their fathers. And never
has the “infant industry” argument been more alive. All
sorts of little trades sought help; for instance, from New
York State came a cry for duty on basket willows; the suppliant
(a woman) complained that she was obliged to compete
with foreign-grown willows sent into the country by the shipload
and sold far below what willows can be grown for in this
country. From Virginia came a cry that mountain ivy root
for making pipes be protected from the competition of brier
wood. There were many more industries like these which
in the nature of the case could affect but a small number of
people that asked that the whole country be taxed that they
be taken care of. There has never been a completer demonstration
of how general the notion has become that no matter
how few are benefited by a duty, it is fair to ask the whole
mass to subscribe to the fund. Hundreds of pages of testimony
are given to requests not to disturb the present schedules
unless it be to <i>increase</i> the duty, and when sifted down the
reason of the requests is not protection, but prohibition.
How ridiculously lacking the testimony was in anything like
satisfactory proof of the cost of production here and abroad,
one has only to read to see. It was evident that almost
none of the manufacturers knew the facts the committee
needed. All that the great majority could offer were the
phrases they had learned in their youth or had been taught
by their predecessors in business. They were men influenced
by a superstition, and it is probable few, if any of them, will
escape from its influence until, like Mr. Carnegie, they retire
from business. Then we may expect some of them to come,
as Mr. Carnegie has done, with ridicule and derision for the
whole system,—to say, as he did, of the duty seekers:</p>

<p class='c007'><i>They are incapable of judging. No judge should be permitted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>to sit in a cause in which he is interested; you make
the greatest mistake in your life if you attach importance to an
interested witness.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>But it was not the character of the information presented
which was the most sinister phase of the “Hearings”; it
was the pressure which one felt the informer could exercise
on Congress when the time came. These hundreds of witnesses,
organized or unorganized, all possessed more or less
political importance. They had it in their power to upset
local machines, displace local bosses, defeat Congressmen,
hold back campaign contributions, make endless mischief.
They had been trained for years to expect reward for political
support in the shape of duties. They were not going to give it
up in a day. They had behind them bodies of favored workmen
trained to believe that high wages depended on protection,
and these favored workmen were not going to give up
their creed in a night. Congressmen knew this well enough.
They knew in 1909, when they began work on the Payne-Aldrich
Bill, that they were in the position they had been for
forty years and more—forced to make a bill with a divided
mind—to fix duties with an eye to what effect it was going
to have on the fall elections in their districts—on campaign
funds for the next presidential election.</p>

<p class='c007'>The absurdity, even criminality, of these methods, which
have persisted so long, was completely demonstrated in the
course of the Payne-Aldrich Bill in the making of the schedule
which for twenty years has been the most important in our
tariff, from a doctrinal and a political point of view, and that is
K, the wool schedule. When the late revision was undertaken
duties were in operation which had been forced from a reluctant
Congress in 1897, solely by the political power of the
combined Wool-Growers Association and the National Association
of Wool Manufacturers. In the decade following the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>adoption of the Dingley Bill the power of the former organization
waned. The members of the “wool trinity” who had
held so strong a whip over Congress were dead. Ohio, which
had been their headquarters, no longer felt the life-and-death
interest it once had in prohibitive wool duties. But the second
association was as alive and ready for action as ever, and
in the fall of 1908, when Mr. Taft’s promises of tariff revision
became reasonably convincing, the head of the Association,
Mr. William Whitman of Boston, called together those in the
business whose interests were identical with his, and they
sought counsel with the growers of wool in the far West. In
October of 1908 the two interests met in Chicago. Mr.
Whitman says that this conference was called at the suggestion
of the wool-growers. For people who had taken an
initiative the wool-growers were very modest. They said
frankly they were not prepared to talk extensively on tariff
questions, that they had come to listen. Mr. Whitman did
the talking, and to such good effect that the conference
decided: “it is the sense of this meeting that in the coming
revision of the tariff the present duties on wool and woollen
goods be maintained without reduction.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Some two months later Mr. Whitman appeared before the
Ways and Means Committee with an elaborate argument for
preserving the wool duties. He made a particular point of
defending the duty on raw wool. “Fair Play for All Interests”
is the subhead under which Mr. Whitman asked that
the tax on his raw material be continued. The Bulletin of
the Wool Association puts the principle this way: “The
traditions of the association all condense themselves into the
Golden Rule”—“Do unto others as you would have others
do to you; between grower and manufacturer and as between
one manufacturer and another, that has always been the
guiding principle.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>Before Mr. Whitman was excused from cross-examination,
however, a serious questioning of his interpretation of the
Golden Rule was introduced into the testimony. It came
from a maker of carded woollens as distinguished from worsteds,
Mr. Edward Moir, of Marcellus, New York. The
carded woollen manufacturers, like many other innocent
Americans, took the results of the presidential election of
1908 as evidence that the tariff was to be thoroughly revised.
“At last,” said they, “we shall get relief.” Accordingly,
soon after the election, Mr. Moir, learning that there was to be
a meeting of the National Association of Wool Manufacturers,
and supposing that the revision of the wool schedule was to be
discussed, presented himself at the gathering. To his surprise
he found that some weeks before the election, about the
time, indeed, that Mr. Taft’s promises of downward revision
were most definite and vigorous, representatives of this association
had met representatives of the wool-growers of the far
West, and the two had made what they called a “solemn
compact” to <i>resist all changes in the wool schedule</i>! The inequalities
were to stand. The carded woollen mills were to be
fed carpet wool and cotton if they could get them, the man
on small income was to continue to wear cotton worsteds
and sleep under cotton blankets, the well-to-do were to continue
to pay $1.50 for cloth they could buy in England for
seventy-five cents. When Mr. Moir protested, he found he
stood alone; <i>i.e.</i> he found that the <i>National Association of
Wool Manufacturers apparently represented the worsted industry</i>.
A little later, when the Ways and Means Committee
began its hearings, Mr. Moir found that this same association
was giving information on what the wool schedule needed,
and that it did not include help for him. Outraged, he went
to work to organize the carded woollen men. Over one hundred
were soon in line, and this body carried its grievance to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>the Ways and Means Committee. The reports of the tariff
hearings contain some very interesting explanations from
Mr. Whitman of the points of which the carded woollen men
complained. Take the matter discussed in the last chapter,
of collecting 11 cents on every pound of grease wool imported
into the country, regardless of quality or value, or whether it
shrinks 15 or 80 per cent. How did Mr. Whitman defend
this duty, which is, as one can see, the very foundation of his
advantage over his competitors? He defended it almost
hysterically by the claim that it is only a specific duty, which
will prevent undervaluation at the customs. Mr. Whitman
buys his wool according to its value. He does not insist
upon paying a fixed price through fear of misrepresentation.
Wool is a standard like wheat and corn. Centuries of experience
have made men expert in judging its value. Undoubtedly
there would be efforts at undervaluation if the
duty were according to value. But a specific duty does not
prevent fraud—witness the Sugar Trust. Everybody knows
that such cheating is dangerous work. Even the Sugar Trust,
with all its cunning, has not escaped entirely. There would be
little chance for the regular importer to do much cheating,
and if there was a percentage of fraud, what could it amount
to compared with a <i>duty which is always unfair</i>, which is
actually a <i>legalized fraud</i>?</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Whitman’s defence of the amount of compensation
allowed manufacturers for the duty on grease wool was interesting
also. It will be remembered that this duty on wool
worth over 40 cents a pound is 44 cents; that is, it is reckoned
as if four pounds of grease wool were used in making a pound
of cloth. Mr. Whitman defends this ratio, so rarely correct,
by using the same argument with which Mr. Aldrich
met the attack upon it in 1890 when the McKinley Bill was
making.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>“It is true that certain wools do not shrink so much, but <i>whether
they do or not is not the point</i>. The American manufacturer must be
reimbursed on the basis of the shrinkage of wools used by his
foreign competitors or <i>available for the latter’s use</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This is as hard to follow as the long-standing consolation
offered to the complaining consumer that “<i>the foreigner pays
the tax</i>.” However, it is hardly more away from the point
than Mr. Whitman’s second defence of the 4 to 1 ratio, which,
in essence, is that it must be right because it was so fixed in
1867! Curiously enough, while Mr. Whitman defends the
4 to 1 ratio because it was decided on by the compact of ’67,
he insists that 55 per cent ad valorem on cloth is none too
much, although in 1867 the manufacturer considered 25 per
cent sufficient!</p>

<p class='c007'>But the carded wool men were not the only branch of the
industry which disputed the soundness of Mr. Whitman’s
“fair play for all” schedule. A few weeks after his hearing,
it came out that one great branch of the woollen industry,
the carpet manufacturers, had left the National Association
in a body. They had wakened up to the fact that for some
twenty years or so they had been serving largely as cat’spaws
for the worsted makers’ chestnuts. They had refused
to contribute further to the organization, and frankly bolted
Schedule K, asking for a common-sense adjustment of the
duty on carpet wools.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most sensational and serious attack on Mr. Whitman’s
testimony was made, on the very day he appeared, in a pamphlet
distributed to the committee. It bore an ugly title,
“How an exorbitant duty on wool tops was concealed in the
Dingley law by the cunning manipulation of S. N. D. North
and William Whitman.” The name attached to the pamphlet
as author was that of a man well known in wool circles,
the editor of the <cite>American Cotton and Wool Reporter</cite>, Frank
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>P. Bennett. In proof of the charges he made, Mr. Bennett
offered documentary proof of the first order. Nothing less
than extracts from letters which had passed between Mr.
North and Mr. Whitman at the time of the “cunning manipulation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>To those familiar with the personal relations of the three
gentlemen the substance of the charges was not new. They
had been first made by Mr. Bennett the year after the passage
of the Dingley Bill (1898) and in very precise form.
What they amounted to then was that Mr. North, although
the paid secretary of the National Association of Wool Manufacturers,
had worked on Mr. Aldrich’s Finance Committee
while it was busy with the Dingley Bill, as “the paid lobbyist
of William Whitman and one other manufacturer,”—that
he had secured benefits for them “regardless of other interests,”
and that “these gentlemen now (1898) aimed at the
control of the United States Census, which they proposed to
secure by having Mr. North (their agent) made director of
the Census!” It was an ugly looking accusation, and naturally
the association appointed a committee to look into the matter.
Both Mr. North and Mr. Whitman made statements. They
amounted to a complete denial of all the charges, and particularly
of any tampering with the top duty. Mr. Whitman
showed by the documents he presented that the duty on tops
as it finally appeared in the Dingley Bill was the same as that
fixed by the McKinley Bill. He also showed it had been
retained at the request of the wool-growers. He said that
when he discovered this duty was in the Dingley wool schedule
he wrote a letter of protest to Mr. Dingley, in which he said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“As tops now stand in the proposed tariff bill, the duty is absolutely
prohibitory.... This places me in a very awkward position
before the community. Nearly everybody in this part of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>country is aware of the fact that the Arlington Mills, of which I am
the treasurer, has just completed an enormous plant for the manufacture
of tops, and everybody will say that, through my influence,
there has been secured upon tops prohibitory duties. Yarn spinners
and weavers will complain, although they may not be directly
affected; but everybody who is at all jealous or envious will charge
that this duty has been imposed at my solicitation.... The
objections, then, that I have to the top rates as now incorporated
in the bill are:</p>

<p class='c014'>“1st. That they are unnecessarily high and will do nobody any
good.</p>

<p class='c014'>“2d. They are so high on the article our mills manufacture as
to create unfavorable criticism.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This letter and the strong and definite denials of Mr. North
and Mr. Whitman were considered satisfactory by the
investigating committee, which announced that in its judgment
the statements of Mr. Bennett were “malicious and
unwarranted,” and that he had forfeited his right to membership
in the association.</p>

<p class='c007'>The matter probably would have ended there if four years
later, 1902, Mr. Bennett had not sued a Lynn, Massachusetts,
newspaper for libel. When the case was tried the newspaper
summoned various witnesses to prove that Mr. Bennett’s
newspaper, the <cite>United States Investor</cite>, made a practice of
blackmailing concerns which did not advertise in it. Among
those witnesses was Mr. Whitman. In the course of his
testimony, Mr. Bennett’s lawyer, Moorfield Storey, saw an
opportunity to demand Mr. Whitman’s correspondence over
the years of the making of the Dingley Bill. The court
upheld him, and all of Mr. Whitman’s political letters of that
period—“<i>My entire private correspondence, embracing correspondence
with every member I have relations with, private and
public</i>,” Mr. Whitman said of the letters—were turned over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>to Mr. Bennett, who at once took copies of those which interested
him. It was nearly seven years before Mr. Bennett
found a sufficiently dramatic moment in which to use the
letters he took from Mr. Whitman’s file. It came finally—the
day when Mr. Whitman was explaining to the Ways and
Means Committee why a wool schedule made in 1867 should
be preserved in 1909.</p>

<p class='c007'>As related above, Mr. Whitman had cleared himself in 1898
from Mr. Bennett’s charge of manipulating the top duty in
the Dingley Bill by publishing a letter he had written to Mr.
Dingley protesting <i>against</i> the duty. He had also related
that Mr. Dingley had accepted his suggestion and had put it
into the bill, and that the reason it had not appeared finally
was that the wool-growers had objected so strenuously that
the committee had given in to them. This looked all right,
but there was a chapter of which Mr. Whitman and Mr.
North said nothing, and of which Mr. Bennett had no proof
until he got hold of the correspondence, and this chapter was
published in the little pamphlet distributed by Mr. Bennett
to the Ways and Means Committee on December 2, 1908.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems that when the top duty suggested by Mr. Whitman
came to the Senate Committee in 1897 it struck a snag at
once. It was <i>prohibitive</i>—just as the higher one for which
it had been substituted—<i>the figures were different, but not their
effect</i>. Mr. North was summoned to explain—the Finance
Committee having apparently accepted him as its wool
expert. Mr. North consulted Mr. Whitman and an agitated
correspondence followed. The letters to Mr. North show that
Mr. Whitman was in great alarm lest the duty he had suggested
be lowered: “No possible legislation in connection with
the woollen schedule would be so dangerous to the woollen
industry as legislation which would <i>favor the importation of
tops</i>.” “You know how important it is, not only to me, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>to the whole wool industry of the United States, that such rates
of duty should be imposed upon tops as will enable them to
be made here <i>and not to be imported</i> from foreign countries.”
“The prosperity of the woollen industry in this country depends
wholly upon the <i>ability of the domestic manufacturers
to manufacture the tops here</i>.” “It is of the greatest importance
that the Arlington Mills products (tops and yarns) have the
<i>full measure</i> of protection accorded to associated industries.”
These extracts and the context show conclusively that though
Mr. Whitman may not have wanted a rate so high that it
would be suspicious, he was after a duty which would be prohibitive,
and that he was depending upon the confidential
relations of the paid secretary of the wool association with
members of the United States Senate in charge of the tariff
bill to secure what he wanted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Whitman’s second defence—that it was the wool-growers,
not he, that kept the high duty on tops in the Dingley
Bill—loses its weight also when one looks into the origin of that
duty. It first appeared in the McKinley Bill of 1890, and so
far as the writer has been able to discover from an extended
examination of the debates and hearings, the top duty was
<i>devised</i> for the McKinley Bill by Mr. Whitman. Nobody
else ever seems to have had anything to do with it. He advocated
it in 1889 before the Senate Finance Committee.
He presented it in January, 1890, to the Ways and Means
Committee, explaining and defending it. Mr. Whitman
was the father of the obnoxious top duty. He found it was
suspicious. He revised it so that it would “look better,”
but do the same work!</p>

<p class='c007'>In spite of ample proof of gross unfairness and trickery in
the Dingley wool schedule, Mr. Payne reported it practically
unchanged. As it passed the House it still gave to Mr.
Whitman a prohibitive duty on his tops. The Finance Committee
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>was equally complaisant, for, as Mr. Aldrich, its chairman,
said later, the schedule as he reported it to the Senate
“followed precisely the act of 1897 in every word.” But
when the wool schedule reached the Senate for debate, its
smooth passage was over, for there on May 5, 1909, it was
treated to one of the most searching analyses of duties which
has ever been made in Congress. The significant fact was
that it came from a Republican who had been for twenty years
in Congress, and who had served on the Dingley Ways and
Means Committee,—Senator Dolliver of Iowa, one of a group
who, when they had discovered by the character of the bill
reported from the House and by the attitude of the majority
of the party in the Senate towards it that there was no intention
of treating seriously the campaign promises of revising
the tariff downward, had revolted: insurgents, they were
called. These men all believed in the doctrine of protection,
and most of them had been all their political lives under the
spell of the notion that it had created American prosperity.
But they were honest men, and slowly they had awakened to
a consciousness that the sacred dogma had been stretched and
twisted in the last fifty years until it had been made literally
to cover a multitude of sins. They saw how its meaning had
been manipulated to justify unscrupulous duties whose only
contribution to prosperity was turning the profits of labor and
natural wealth into some private pocket. They all seem to
have taken without reserve the latest strain put upon the
protective formula in order that it might cover whatever a
manufacturer wanted, the form in which it had appeared in
the Republican platform of 1908, insuring the person lucky
enough to have a business which could be protected that he
should have a duty which would not only cover the difference
in the cost of his production, but insure him a profit. The
insurgents did not object to this interpretation, but they saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>at once that Mr. Aldrich in reporting his bill had no intention,
in cases where duties had been advanced, of giving the Senate
evidence that the difference in the cost of production here
and abroad made an advance necessary, that the facts he
had he refused to make public. I asked Senator Bristow
of Kansas, whom I knew to be a strong and convinced protectionist,
what started his revolt against the bill? “Red
paint,” he replied promptly. “I was interested in that. We
paint our barns with it in Kansas. I saw them putting up
duties which I believed would affect its cost. I wanted to
know why. I could find no reason—no proof that it was
necessary. I insisted, and I soon made up my mind that
they had no intention of considering the difference in the cost
of production, that they sneered at the idea, that they were
simply intent on giving their political supporters what they
wanted. Moreover, they intended to force us to be a party
to the business. It was the most dishonest and corrupt
work I have ever seen, and I revolted.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The insurgents determined to demonstrate to the country
the utter unscrupulousness of the leaders of their own party,
and to do this effectively they divided among themselves the
schedules which they knew to be most important politically
and therefore to be most open to suspicion, the intention being
thoroughly to master their intricacies. Schedule K fell to
Senator Dolliver. Now Senator Dolliver had always been
what one may call a McKinley protectionist or prohibitionist.
He had followed that leader with the unquestioning
fidelity which the man had the ability to inspire in many
who knew him. His speeches in the ’90’s are brilliant and witty
defences of the new interpretation of protection which the
party for political reasons was trying to force on the country.
They are thoroughly orthodox and thoroughly unsound. In
1897 Mr. Dolliver was a member of the Dingley Ways and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>Means Committee, which seriously tried to lower the rates in
all the schedules, and particularly in wool. He had seen the
effort frustrated by the very group whom he knew now to be
behind the wool bill which Mr. Aldrich reported. He determined
to master the history and the operation of the schedule
in so thorough a fashion that he could go on to the floor of
the Senate or on to any platform and make clear to a popular
audience its tricks and its injustices. He believed that such
an exposure must in the long run kill it. Now the wool
schedule is one of the most difficult in our tariff laws to understand
and to explain. It is really the accumulation of fifty
years of active superstition and greed. An ocular demonstration
of the change in its character and its intelligibility
may be had by comparing the wool schedule of fifty years ago
and that of to-day as printed in the official collection of United
States tariff bills. Fifty years ago wool was disposed of in
perhaps fifty words, which anybody could understand; to-day
it takes some three thousand, and as for intelligibility, nobody
but an expert versed in the different grades of wools, of
yarns, and of woollen articles could tell what the duty really is.
It is a mistake to suppose that because a man has been twenty
years in Congress and has served for a portion of that time on
the Ways and Means Committee, he therefore understands
the tariff schedules. As a rule, it is safe to say that a Congressman
understands rarely the real meaning of the rates
he votes for. What he understands is that the Committee
has made the bill for what it considers sound party reasons,
and that if he does not accept the rate, he or some colleague
is in danger of defeat, and he accepts it without too much
scrutiny. It is a case where it is just as well not to know too
much. Moreover, it takes an amount of hard time-taking
study to master a schedule, which only an occasional man has
the will to give. Senator Dolliver knew that neither he nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>any other insurgent understood enough of wool-growing and
wool manufacturing to cope with the schedule. Later in the
course of the debate he illustrated the difficulties he encountered
in spite of his twenty years in Congress. He was told
that a certain paragraph was worded to conceal a trick.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I had to read it four or five times before I could see the
point where the proposition emerged,” Senator Dolliver said.
“I handed it to intelligent men and asked them if they saw
any distinction in that language between clothing wools and
combing wools, and, one after another, bright men said, ‘I
cannot see any distinction.’ If you will get the paragraph
and read it yourself, you will notice with what delicacy of
phrase, worthy of poets and artists, this distinction has been
wrought into the very foundation of the wool tariff.” Now
it was this aggregation of tricks, evasions, and discriminations
that Senator Dolliver determined to master, and master it he
did, by months of the severest night-work. He poured over
statistics and technical treatises. He visited mills and importing
houses and retail shops. He sought the aid of experts,
and in the end he knew his subject so well that he went on to
the floor of the Senate without a manuscript and literally
played with Schedule K, and incidentally also with Senator
Aldrich and several other stand-patters whose long experience
in juggling with untruths had destroyed their agility
in handling truths.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he had finished his clean, competent dissection,
Schedule K lay before the Senate a law without principles or
morals; and yet, just as it was, the Senate of the United States
passed it, and the President of the United States signed it,
and it went on the statute books, even to Mr. Whitman’s
prohibitive duty on tops.</p>

<p class='c007'>What made Mr. Whitman so powerful? Probably we
shall not go far astray if we assert that the real reason is that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>for many years he and his worsted friends have been one of
the main financial reserves of the high protective wing of the
Republican party in New England, and that in return they
have got what they asked for. That is political ethics—or
etiquette. Ever since 1888 it has been a settled and openly
expressed principle in political circles that your protection
shall be in proportion to your campaign contribution. In
that year it was laid down officially that as the manufacturers
of the United States got “practically the sole benefit of the
tariff” and in prosperous years “made millions” out of it,
therefore it was entirely justifiable that those who granted
the tariff should, when their time of need came, put these
manufacturers “over the fire” and “fry the fat out of them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Whitman’s individual support is not to be despised,
but with it has always gone the support of his association.
It means the support of the great “wool trust” with William
M. Wood at its head, and it means also, as we have seen, the
support of the wool-growers of the far West—not, be it
noted, of <i>all</i> the wool-growers of the country, but of those
who, like the worsted manufacturers, are getting more out of
the present duties than their competitors, and are therefore
most anxious to keep them. These are the men who produce
a wool which on an average will yield only about 44 pounds
of clean wool in every 100 pounds sheared from the sheep.
Yet their protection on this 100 pounds is the same as that of
the farmer of the South whose wool yields 60 pounds to every
100, or the Eastern and Middle state farmers whose wool
yields 52 out of every 100 pounds. The protests of these
Eastern, Southern, and Middle West farmers that they are
not fairly treated were no more heeded by the makers of the
Payne-Aldrich Bill than the protests of the carded woollen and
carpet manufacturers. The reason is obvious enough. The
Western wool-growers are as loyal and generous in their support
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>of their Senators as are Mr. Whitman and Mr. Wood
of theirs. Each group—the wool-growers of the far West
and the worsted manufacturers of the East—controls a good-sized
block of votes. By uniting these blocks they control
probably the largest and most dependable vote of any tariff-protected
interest in the country. It is a vote which for
over forty years has never bolted. It is a vote which always
gets what it asks, for the simple reason that it is powerful
enough to defeat any duty in a tariff bill if the backer of that
duty is hostile, and nobody doubts it will exercise the power
if tried. It is the size and solidarity of the vote which explains
why when, through the boldness of the insurgents, the
most odious features in the wool business had been laid before
the Senate and a motion was made to send Schedule K
back to the committee for revision, it was lost by 8 yeas and
59 nays. It is Mr. Taft’s reason—given frankly enough
after he found the odium of allowing the schedule to stand
was not going to pass. “<i>The interests of the wool-growers in
the far West</i>,” said Mr. Taft, “<i>and the interests of the wool
manufacturers in the Eastern states, and in other states, reflected
through their Representatives in Congress, were sufficiently
strong to defeat any attempt to change the wool tariff,
and had it been attempted it would have beaten the bill reported
from either committee.</i>” Apparently the same combine was
strong enough to prevent the presidential veto the country
had a right to expect from Mr. Taft.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not less significant than the experience of wool in the
Payne-Aldrich Bill was that of cotton.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Mr. Aldrich reported the bill of 1909 to the Senate
on April 12, there was lively curiosity in many quarters about
what the cotton schedule would contain. Rumors were
general that it had been cleverly manipulated in its passage
through the Ways and Means Committee. It was said that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>Mr. Payne had declared “in language somewhat exaggerated
by impiety,” as Senator Dolliver afterward put it, that he
had been <i>fooled</i> by the gentleman who had presented the
needs of the schedule to him. It was known that he was so
certain of the odium of a certain paragraph which he had
reported that he had risen in the House and withdrawn it.
It was certain that the first publication of the schedule had
drawn down an avalanche of criticism and charges of bad
faith, many of them from the most respectable and best informed
trade sources. So vigorous and authoritative had
the attack been that many believed that Mr. Aldrich would
not venture to report the schedule which the House had sent
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Schedule I, as the cotton schedule is known, is one of first
importance. In 1905 there were over six hundred and thirteen
million dollars invested in cotton manufactures in this
country. The product was something over four hundred
and forty-two million dollars—a big proposition from every
point of view, not one to be lightly or dogmatically treated.
A question of humanity, too, as well as of economics, for there
were over 310,000 persons employed, 125,000 of whom were
women, and 40,000 children under sixteen years of age.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not against the entire schedule that charges had been
brought, but against that which concerns itself with woven
goods—that is, sheetings, shirtings, muslins, calicoes. A very
large proportion of the product in cottons comes under this
head. Fully three hundred and eight of the four hundred
and forty-two millions of dollars of cotton products produced
in 1905 was in woven goods. Now all woven goods have been
protected for many years, and so well protected that the importations
in 1905 were only about eight millions of dollars—or
about 2⅔ per cent of the product. These importations
were not scattered over the whole group of cotton goods—they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>were concentrated on the higher grades. Of the cheaper
cotton goods there is almost no importation; on the contrary,
we exported over forty million dollars’ worth of them
in 1905. What that means, of course, is that we have come to
a point in making the cheap grades of cottons where we do not
need much, if any, protection, since we can afford to export
and sell them in competition with English-made goods.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the higher grades of goods it is another story. We
cannot make them as cheap as they are made abroad. We
are turning out many really beautiful cotton fabrics, and our
qualities and designs are continually improving, but they cost
us more. The protection given all these better grade fabrics,
however, has been sufficient to permit a great expansion in
this part of the industry, and while it has not prevented
importation, it has probably allowed no more than was a
healthy stimulus to the industry. At least this was the opinion
given to the Ways and Means Committee by the most
important witness that appeared before it on cotton—Henry
F. Lippitt, the general manager of the important group of
Rhode Island mills in the Manville Company. Mr. Lippitt
is a member of one of the half dozen or so families in whose
hands the textile industries of Rhode Island are largely concentrated.
His father, grandfather, and great-grandfather
were cotton manufacturers. They were able men at their
trade, as he is. They were also, as he is, stiff protectionists
and active Republican politicians. Mr. Lippitt’s father and
one of his brothers have been governors of Rhode Island. He
has always been one of the main stays of the party in the
state—a support of the blind Boss Brayton and one of Mr.
Aldrich’s stanchest friends. Since the passage of the Payne-Aldrich
Bill Mr. Lippitt has succeeded to Mr. Aldrich’s seat
in the Senate. Mr. Lippitt’s expression about what was
needed in the cotton schedule was accepted as authoritative,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>and this is what he said on December 1, 1908, when he appeared
as a representative of the Arkwright Club of Boston:</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are going to ask you to leave the duty as it is on the
cloth schedule with the exception of <i>some very minor points</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We ask that the present schedule shall not be materially
changed and that cotton manufacturers be allowed to continue
the operation and further development of this important
industry <i>upon the same tariff conditions that now prevail</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>The importations are not so large that we feel justified in
asking that the duties be increased, but we would not like to see
them decreased.</i>”</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon this representation of the “wants” of the manufacturers
the trade rested. If Mr. Lippitt asked that the
schedule be left as it was, there was general confidence that it
would be done. There seems to have been little or no
curiosity about “the very minor points” to which Mr.
Lippitt referred. He did not make these known to the Committee
itself until some six weeks later. Then in a letter
written for the Arkwright Club of Boston, the leading organization
of cotton manufacturers in the country, Mr. Lippitt
and a fellow manufacturer, Mr. J. R. MacColl, the manager
of the Lorraine Mills of Pawtucket, Rhode Island, made certain
suggestions to Mr. Payne. This letter was not read at the
public hearings; it was not published until the Appendix to the
hearings came out. The first the public knew of it was when
Mr. Payne reported his bill to the House on March 17, 1909;
and then an uproar began. Far from “minor” changes having
been made, it was declared that radical and complicated
ones sure to bring great confusion had been introduced. To
make the cotton schedule any more complicated than it has
been for fifty years is in itself a severe criticism. Under the
Dingley Bill cotton cloth was subject to <i>four</i> distinct classifications
in fixing duties. These were based upon the number
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>of threads to a square inch, the weight, color, and value.
Duties were graded also according to the varying fineness,
weight, and value, so that there were scores of combinations
in duties possible. If, after all this, the cloth had a figure
worked in it, as so many of the finer goods do, there was an
extra duty per square yard for that.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would seem difficult to add anything to this complication,
but Mr. Payne’s bill did it. It began by upsetting
an established definition in the cotton trade—a definition
accepted the world over as to what the word “thread” means
in appraising cloth. A thread has been a thread, regardless
of how many filaments or ply were twisted together to make
it. This was no longer to be so. The poor appraiser could
no longer apply his magnifying glass to a square inch of
cotton cloth and count the threads: he must untwist a thread
and compute the number of ply! Of course this immediately
threw the fabric into a higher classification than under the old
law, and increased the duty on it. A cloth which counted
fifty threads carried under the old law a duty of say one cent
per square yard, but if these threads were three ply—and
each ply must be counted by the new paragraph—then it
was at once boosted into the one hundred and fifty thread
class, where the duty is one and one-half cents per square
yard! This was the first of Mr. Lippitt’s “very minor
points.” But this did not end the counting business. There
is a great variety of cotton cloths which have figures worked
on to the body. The swisses and curtain madras are common
examples of these. These figures, of course, increase the value
of the goods, and the Dingley Bill provided for them by giving
them an extra one or two cents per square yard, according
as they cost seven or over seven cents a square yard. But
Mr. Payne’s bill went this duty one better by arranging that
when the threads of a cloth were counted not the threads in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>body alone should be considered, but also the <i>threads in the
figure worked on the body</i>. Here again the number of threads
in a square inch would be so increased as to throw the fabric
into a higher class and so raise the duty. Another increase
came in the matter of color. Heretofore the body of the
cloth had been all that was considered in estimating color,
but the new law proposed that cloth into which colored figures
or threads had been introduced should be called colored. A
single colored thread introduced into a white piece was enough
to throw it into the colored class. One entirely new duty was
added, and that was a cent a yard for cloth which had been
mercerized—and a single mercerized thread was enough to
put a piece into this class.</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides all this reclassification, the duties which in the
Dingley Bill had been added for the value of the cloth were
increased and complicated in a most irritating fashion—by
dividing the values into several classes. There was one duty
for cloths worth 12½ to 15 cents, another for those worth
15 to 17½, another for those worth from 17½ to 20. But who
was to fix the value when the margins were so narrow? It
was a temptation to fraud,—the importer naturally trying to
prove that the cloth worth 13 cents was worth but 12½; his
opponent, the domestic manufacturer, trying to prove that
the cloth really worth 12½ was worth 13.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Payne reported a schedule then which not only raised
duties on many kinds of cotton goods, but multiplied the
opportunities for fraud and added seriously to the work of
appraising. Mr. Payne claimed to have been entirely misled
about what the new rates would do—at least about the
changes in counting threads—for when the schedule came
up he rose in the House and asked that the old methods of
counting be restored, and he said with an emphasis which
showed his disgust at the way he felt he had been tricked:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>“The committee has not sought to increase the duty by that
method. If they wanted to increase the duty, they <i>would go
in the open to do it</i>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The cotton schedule came to Mr. Aldrich, therefore, under
suspicion—suspicion of having been cleverly and slyly
revised upwards by the advice of one of his strongest and most
generous political supporters, the man who had the credit
of managing his last senatorial campaign and collecting the
large sums of money which it required to reëlect him. Naturally
the curiosity was keen about what Mr. Aldrich would
report. What he reported was, with one exception, just what
Mr. Lippitt and Mr. MacColl had asked for. He did not
stand for the new definition of thread which they had invented,
but he did provide that the number of threads and the color
should no longer depend on the body of a cloth, but should
be estimated by the figure wrought into it. He practically
asked that if a single colored thread was woven in or applied
to a piece of shirting, it should take the added duty which was
given to colored goods. He also stood by the clause which
put an additional cent on all which had even one mercerized
thread in them, and by the complicated specific duties which
had been invented for all goods costing over 12½ cents per
square yard.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now if Mr. Aldrich believed that the rates on these particular
cotton goods should be raised and complicated in this way,
he was justified in raising them; but there has never been a
time in the history of protection in this country when it was
more imperative for a new and increased duty to be clearly
explained. There was never a time when it was more necessary
that all rates should be measured by the fundamental
principles of protection. It was Mr. Aldrich’s business to
prove to the Senate that the new rates were justifiable. But
Mr. Aldrich made no attempt to do anything of the kind.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>On the contrary, when the charges were taken sharply to
account by Senator Dolliver in an analysis which must stand
as a model of the kind of criticism which every schedule in the
tariff bill needs <i>from Protectionists</i>, Mr. Aldrich met him by
asserting that the rates on cotton goods <i>had not been raised</i>.
That all that had been done was to readjust duties in such a
way as to restore the “<i>intent</i>” of the Dingley Bill, which, he
said, had been largely destroyed by certain court decisions.
It is easy to show how far from the fact Mr. Aldrich was in
his statement. The fabrics which had been referred to the
courts were few in number, including the goods known as
etamine and Madras curtain goods. There had been no
court decision whatever affecting the great bulk of plain
cotton goods, white or colored; and yet the tables estimating
duties which are to-day in use by one of the largest and most
respected importing houses in this country show that the increase
in duties on colored cotton cloths of from 100 to 150
threads per square inch are all the way from about 2 to 42 per
cent, and as usually happens the 2 per cent increase is on the
<i>highest priced</i> goods. If these same goods were mercerized,
the increase in duties is from about 12 to 56 per cent. In
the next higher grade of fineness (over 150 and not over 200
threads) the duties have increased from 2 to 24 per cent—if
mercerized, from 14 to 38 per cent. White goods of the ordinary
weaves of the same grades of fineness as those above
have like increases. Not one of these cloths <i>was touched or
could be touched by the court decisions Mr. Aldrich hid behind</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was inevitable that when the effect of the changes was
made clear there should have been at once a cry raised that
Mr. Aldrich, in allowing these increases of duties, was rewarding
Mr. Lippitt for the able work it was known that he had
done in the last senatorial campaign. It was pointed out
that the goods affected were not common coarse goods. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>were the higher grades which are made in the Manville Mills,
and well made. It was also said that Mr. Lippitt was adding
to his mills a big mercerizing plant. “He expects to pay for
it out of that extra cent,” the cynical said. It was certainly
natural and necessary that Mr. Aldrich should resent these
charges, but Mr. Aldrich went a little too far in his denials,
and, taken <i>seriatim</i>, they look queer, at least.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No manufacturer has been before the Committee on
Finance in regard to this schedule. Every change that was
made in it was made upon the recommendation of the government
experts and nobody else.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But later Mr. Aldrich said: “They (the new rates) are the
creation of the <i>committee itself</i>, and no man was consulted either
on the Board of Appraisers or anywhere else with reference
to these provisions until the committee had decided what
they should be”; and again—“The <i>committee</i> having decided
what to do, they turned the matter of <i>regulating</i> the
schedules to the experts of the government, and never to
any manufacturer at any time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is probably true that Mr. Lippitt was not before the
Senate committee. It was not necessary. His suggestion
made to the Ways and Means Committee had been used by
Mr. Aldrich almost intact. Moreover, the work of the
“experts” to which Mr. Aldrich referred had been done with
Mr. Lippitt. It was an open secret in Washington that Mr.
Lippitt spent weeks with Messrs. Sharretts and De Vries, the
government experts, whom Mr. Aldrich said first had made
every change in the cotton schedule and whom, a little later, he
said had done nothing of the kind, but simply <i>regulated</i> them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Moreover, reference to “experts,” coming from Mr. Aldrich
at that point in the making of the bill of 1909 did not inspire
confidence. Something of the character of the work “experts”
had done for him in 1897 had been sufficiently demonstrated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>by Frank P. Bennett, in the matter of William Whitman
and his top duty. If that was what Mr. Aldrich understood
by experts, then it was certain it was the kind of tariff-making
which the country had set out to correct—a species
of jugglery in the interests of some good campaign contributor
made by a specialist willing to turn his knowledge to adroit
manipulation. That there was a general suspicion around
Washington that one of the “experts” who aided Mr. Lippitt,
and was now aiding Mr. Aldrich, had done something of the
same kind of work for the Senator in regard to sugar in 1897,
only added to the severity of the criticism which greeted his
effort to unload the cotton duties. However, in falling back
on “experts” Mr. Aldrich was only taking us at our word.
We have all talked more or less volubly about “tariffs made
by experts.” Mr. Aldrich gave us an example of what it
may be in the cotton schedule. It turns out that it can easily
be something like the familiar “business administration” of
municipalities—administrations ably conducted to give the
conductors what they want.</p>

<p class='c007'>In defending the charges against the cotton schedule Mr.
Aldrich made the following statements:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The existing law, by a series of undervaluations on the
part of importers and of erroneous construction on the part of
the general appraisers and the courts, has been so emasculated
that the interests of the cotton manufacturers of the United
States have been largely destroyed in some lines. This is
shown by the fact that the importation of cotton manufactures
increased from $23,000,000 in 1898 to $73,000,000 in
1907.” Mr. Aldrich was mistaken in his figures. The
cotton importations in 1898 were over $27,000,000, and 1898
was an “off-year.” The average importations in the decade
1896–1905 were over $40,000,000. Moreover, nobody knows
better than Mr. Aldrich that not over $12,000,000 of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>$73,000,000 imported in 1907 referred to cotton cloths—the
only thing in dispute. The other $61,000,000 was duty
on our large importations of cotton laces, embroideries, and
small goods like handkerchiefs and hosiery. It was a misleading
statement, not unlike the statements by which the
duty on mercerized goods was defended. The task of defending
this fell to Mr. Lodge in the main,—the senior Senator
from Massachusetts, and Mr. Smoot from Utah, being the
senatorial team which backed up Mr. Aldrich in the tariff
debate. Mr. Lodge’s speech was most interesting. He had
been admirably coached on mercerization, and he had his
samples with him. He told how it had become a general
process since the Dingley Bill was made—that it required new
and expensive machinery and skilled labor—hence for labor’s
sake and the honor of our cotton trade we should give it a
special duty. What Mr. Lodge did not say was that this
process, in so far as it adds anything to the value of a cloth, was
already provided for in the Dingley Bill. That under the
protection there provided, it had become in some ten years
firmly and successfully established in the United States. The
latest textile directory gives a list of fifty-seven concerns which
do some form of mercerizing. Some of these are on a large
scale. When Mr. Lippitt appeared before the Ways and
Means Committee one of the strong reasons he gave for not
changing the Dingley duty was that under it the trade had
been able to develop on artistic lines and to employ new
processes, such as mercerization. He repeated that the
Dingley duty was sufficient. Mr. Lodge’s speech would lead
one to believe that we had been unable to mercerize goods,
that it was an infant needing protection, whereas fifty-seven
establishments announce that they do the work! Moreover,
Mr. Lodge failed to prove that a cent a square yard was necessary
to protect the process. As a matter of fact, it was shown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>by Senator Dolliver that the process costs nothing of the kind.
Bills for mercerizing were shown in which the charge was but
⅛ of a cent a square yard. Other figures were quoted, but
none higher than ¾ of a cent. It is probable that the process
is actually cheaper here than in England or Germany, though
we do not as yet do work of as high grade. All the evidence,
indeed, leads one to believe that there was no sound protectionist
defence of the extra duty on mercerized goods, that
it was an abuse of power from start to finish.</p>

<p class='c007'>The duties on cotton cloth in the Payne-Aldrich Bill were
adopted not for lack of ample information of their nature,
but in spite of it. The members of the responsible committees,
the members of Congress and the Administration, not only
had the debates to guide them; they had laid before them
repeatedly, by the Wholesale Dry Goods Association of New
York, graphic “object lessons” of what the new rates
would do. Discovering that Congress was unmoved by its
showings, as a last resort the Association appealed to the
President for a hearing. They believed that if they could
prove to him the effect of the duties on common goods, he
would not permit the wrong. But the President would not
see them. It is probable that Mr. Taft, knowing that it was
futile to oppose the cotton duties, spared himself the ordeal
of having to say to gentlemen who had a just grievance, “I
can do nothing for you.” It was what he had done in the
case of the carded woollen men. And if Mr. Taft had offered
any explanation of his inactivity, as he did in the case of the
wool schedule, he would probably have said:</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The interests of the cotton manufacturers of New England,
New York, and Pennsylvania, reflected through their representatives
in Congress, were sufficiently strong to defeat any attempt
to change the cotton tariff, and had it been attempted it would
have beaten the bill reported from either committee.</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>What made the cotton manufacturers so strong? Their
alliance in tariff matters with the worsted manufacturers—nothing
else. Side by side with worsted in New England
and New York and Pennsylvania, in all the textile centres, is
cotton. The worsted manufacturers use larger and larger
quantities of cotton in their cheap goods. Worsted manufacturers
are also frequently cotton manufacturers. The
tariff interests of cotton and of worsted manufacturers are
identical. Everywhere we find them supporting the same
political combinations. Senator Aldrich has always been as
liberal in supporting what the wool men wanted as he was
in 1909 in carrying out Mr. Lippitt’s suggestions. So loyal
is he to the wool schedule that in 1909, when the attack was
made by his own party colleagues on its inequalities, he made
the following extraordinary statement:</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>There is no Senator sitting upon this side of the Chamber,
there is no person who is acquainted with the tariffs of this or any
other country, who does not know that an assault upon the wool
and woollen schedule of this bill is an attack upon the very citadel
of protection and the lines of defence for American industries
and American labor. If the Senate destroys the relation in that
schedule or destroys the schedule itself, you demoralize the whole
protective system; and you destroy every line of defence which the
people of this country have who believe in the protective policy.</i>”</p>

<p class='c007'>Now what does this mean? We have seen that the “assault”
on the wool schedule was merely the demand that its
discriminations be adjusted: <i>there was no demand for lowering
duties</i>; but Mr. Aldrich declared if this readjustment
should be made, it would “demoralize the whole protective
system”—destroy the “citadel” and the “lines of defence
for American industries.” Can this mean anything at all
but that it would break up the wool “bulwark,” the combination
of politicians and favored wool-growers and worsted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>manufacturers fattening off the competing branch of the
industry? It can mean nothing else. Destroy the combination
which has kept the old wool schedule in vogue so long,
and you destroy a chief financial support of many congressmen.
Break down this combination in Congress, and what
would happen to cotton? It has no such wide power as wool.
It could not count on getting what it wanted quietly and
unostentatiously as it has always done. Allied with wool, its
case has always been easy. And it was a good alliance for
wool, although not a vital one, for cotton is rich, and when it
comes to funds to return high tariff Senators, it is generous.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fact is that this great politico-industrial alliance of
cotton and worsted has been the backbone of protection.
Not of protection as the country understood it, but of <i>protection
as Mr. Aldrich understood it</i>. To Mr. Aldrich protection
never has been a set of principles to be applied with care
and candor. It has always been a trading system. I think
it is entirely fair to Mr. Aldrich to say that from his first
connection with Congress he saw that the tariff, properly
worked, was the surest road to power and to wealth that this
country offered to a politician. He saw the trading possibilities
in it, and he intelligently and persistently gave his
great ability to developing them. The backbone of the system
he worked out was this alliance between cotton and
worsted. In that alliance he had a dependable block of
votes with which he could carry to success almost any duty
which would strengthen the party, oblige a friend, or help his
own pocket. This block of votes was behind practically
every increase, and manipulation in the bill of 1909. To
Mr. Aldrich’s credit let it be said that he has made as little
pretence that he was not carrying on a traffic in duties as
any man in the business. On the whole, he may be said to
have been frank about it, especially in private.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>The tariff bill of which these schedules were the backbone
became a law on August 5, 1909. There was something distinctly
tragic in the reception the country gave the new
law. Depressed, cynical, sneering comments were heard on
all sides. Congress went home anything but proud of itself.
Here was a piece of legislation which had cost the entire time
of a large body of legislators for more than a year, to which
an extra five months’ session of Congress had been given, and
from it nobody carried away enthusiasm, pride, a sense of
triumph,—nothing but a disagreeable coppery taste of
barter and jugglery, the depressing feeling that he who has
gets, as a rule, in the Congress of the United States. The only
satisfaction was the negative one that at least it was over.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pity of it was that they had had so fine a chance to do
a real thing. It was a task for statesmen. The nature of
it was clear enough. Nobody was for upsetting a reasonable
protection. But practically everybody but the beneficiaries
were for cleaning up the tariff. The evils inherent in it—and
nobody of intelligence ever denied that they were many—were
big, easily seen:</p>

<p class='c007'>Enormous profits to the few; steadily increasing prices to
the many; one-sided development of the country; factories
growing like gourds and no ships of our own to carry the goods
in; the country sacrificed to the city, the peace of God to the
blare and the roar of the steel furnace. These ungrateful
children of protection had grown until they threatened to
crush us. And then the political enormity—the support
given to a great number of over-high duties in order to secure
in return the campaign funds and local influence of those who
profited. These things stared us in the face on every side,
and had become hateful to the people. It looked, in fact,
as if they were coming to be about all there was of the protective
system. There could be, and there was, no quarrel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>among honest men about the necessity of doing a fair housecleaning
job.</p>

<p class='c007'>The method seemed as clear as the task. The definition of
protection accepted by the majority in this country was a
reasonable one. There is scarcely a doubt that every intelligent
voter knew about what it was—that it included tariff
for revenue and tariff for moderate protection, until such time
as an essential industry was on its feet. Now the application
of such a definition ought not to be—and would not be—puzzling,
if it had not become tangled with the proposition
of tariff for politics only. It requires, to be sure, a large
amount of exact information, but such information is obtainable
through experts. It requires, too, firm and consistent
rating through all the schedules. The work obviously
demands to be done by disinterested persons, those who have
no object except to do an honest task. That this was the
only way to get a satisfactory revision everybody knew.
And in the face of this perfectly clear proposition, we got a
bill perpetuating all of the old abuses and made in the same
old way.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is not saying that there was not some very good tinkering
in the bill of 1909. It should not be forgotten that hides
and petroleum were made free, that the duties were lowered
on rough lumber and print paper, and on coal and iron ore,
that a temporary tariff commission was secured; but at no
point did Congress or the President show a real understanding
of the human cry that was at the heart of the movement
which had driven them to undertake the revision.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>There was a great human cause—easing the burden of our
vast laboring class—knocking at the door of Congress, and
it was not heeded—if, indeed, it was heard.</i> True, there was
talk of an “ultimate consumer”—a kind of economic manikin
introduced for convenience in demonstration. But that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>this ultimate consumer was a flesh and blood person there was
no recognition.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Taft seems no more to have understood his great chance
than did Congress. The only case in which he used his
executive power to force Congress to correct a duty which
was obviously an abuse was hides. Mr. Taft withstood a
fierce attack for this duty from the forces to which he
yielded in the far more important matter of wool and
cotton. But it was not high-class bargaining, in which, by
virtue of his office and his power of veto, he was able to wrest
a few concessions, that the country had a right to ask from
Mr. Taft. Leadership was his business. It was for him to
make clear the great need, to inspire the great action, to
create the atmosphere for high endeavor. One big ringing
appeal from Mr. Taft, showing that he felt for the masses of
this country and meant, if possible, that there should be a
fairer division of burdens, that he saw the shame of bartering
legislation for political support and meant to break the practice
if he could, would have been worth many times the concessions
obtained. It was the spirit of tariff reform, the zeal for
honest schedules, the determination that discriminations should
be done away with, indignation at the wretched and shameless
alliances back of the bills, that it was for Mr. Taft to feel and
to foster. But it is evident that he did not feel these things,
and so could not foster them. He had an opportunity to
lead in a great moral awakening on the most serious matter
since the days of slavery. He did not understand the issue.
He saw merely the chance of doing some tinkering, which
he did manfully and effectively.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tariff reform calls for more than lowering a duty here and
there, more than appointing a Tariff Board, more than negotiating
a Reciprocity Treaty, good as all these may be. It
calls for an intellectual and moral revolt against the entire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>system of protection as we know it. No leader can accomplish
the work needed who does not go to the fight hot with
indignation at the intellectual jugglery which has swamped
the protective principle and weakened the country’s capacity
for sound political thinking and its keenness for distinguishing
moral values. Never until such a revolt comes will the clutch
of the greedy beneficiaries of the system be wrenched loose.
The wrong done to mind and morals is a far more serious
matter than any damming up of trade the policy produces.
That at most can endure but a few generations. The laws of
trade are too powerful to be long interrupted by unnatural
barriers like prohibitive tariffs. They finally flow over them
as a river over a dam, and eventually toss them aside like the
drift they are. That is, all tampering with liberty and truth
comes sooner or later to naught. True, in the meantime the
people bear the burden. True, the end of all industrial progress,
that is, the fair distribution of a production sufficient
to keep in health and happiness the people of all the earth,
is put off; but that is less serious than the deterioration of
intellectual and moral integrity which it has required to build
up our dishonest and inhuman tariff laws.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <span class='large'>SOME INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL ASPECTS OF OUR TARIFF-MAKING</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Difficult as it would be for one to realize it who took up
for the first time the present tariffs of the United States, they
rest on a formula which as it always has been understood
by the majority of the people of the country is not especially
intricate or confusing. Put yourself back a hundred years or
so, when the country was busy with agriculture and commerce
and mining. We had an enormous advantage in these
pursuits. We were at a disadvantage in manufacturing.
To be sure, from the start we did a little. In the nature of
things we would gradually do more, and what we did would
be on a solid basis. But, obviously, only the born iron-master,
potter, weaver, was going to practise his trade in the new
country with the foreigner importing goods cheaper than he
as a rule could make them. And so we decided to encourage
manufacturing by taxing ourselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>The amount of the tax decided on was to be only enough to
put our would-be manufacturers on an even basis with the
foreigner. This meant what? By general consent, it meant
giving our people enough to cover the difference in the cost
of labor. Plainly, Americans were not going to work for the
same wages that Europeans did. There were too many ways
in which they could earn more. The country was new, and
men could have land of their own on easy terms. Commerce
called them; for, having land, we were raising foods, and
Europe and the Orient, worn and old and privilege-ridden,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>were crying for food. They could make everything we
wanted, cheap as dirt. They were eager to exchange. If we
were to do our own manufacturing, we were obliged to
devise a scheme which would make the wages of operatives
approximately equal to those which could be earned in our
natural occupations. <i>Thus protection was not adopted for the
sake of producing generous wages for labor. It was adopted
because the rewards to labor in the new country were already
generous and promised to be more so.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>There is another equally important point to remember,
and that is that it was expressly understood that the duty
was never to be prohibitive. It was to be one that would
permit the man at home to compete with the man from
abroad; no more. Sensible people have always agreed that
we would injure ourselves if we allowed prohibitive duties,
since they would <i>cut us off from the stimulus of competition
and also from models</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old countries had been for centuries making the goods
we wanted. <i>They knew how to do it. We needed constantly
before us in our markets the educational effect of their work.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>There were few, if any, at the start to deny that this taxing
of ourselves to establish industries was dangerous business,
undemocratic, of course—probably unconstitutional—and
an obvious bait to the greedy; but they comforted themselves
with the gains which they believed would speedily result.
The list was tempting:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. We were to build up industries which would supply our
own needs.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The laborers attracted into these industries were to
make a larger home market.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. We were soon to out-rival the foreigner in cost of production,
giving the people in return for the tax they had borne
cheaper goods than ever the Old World could give.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>4. We were to outstrip the Old World in quality and variety—another
reward for taxation patiently borne.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. We were to over-produce and with our surplus enter the
markets of the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nobody pretended to deny that if it was found on fair
experiment that these results were impossible in a particular
industry the protection must be withdrawn. Otherwise it
amounted to supporting an industry at public expense—an
unbusinesslike, unfair, and certainly undemocratic performance.</p>

<p class='c007'>But what has happened when the formula has not worked?
Take the failure after decades of costly experiments to grow
all the wool we use, to make woollens of as high a quality and
at a price equal to those of the English. Fully sixty per cent of
the raw wool used in the United States is brought from other
lands, and a tax of 11 or 12 cents is collected on every pound
of it. Our high grade woollens cost on an average twice what
they do in Europe. The fact is, the protective dogma has
not, and probably never can, make good in wools and woollens.
It is one of those cases where we can use land, time, labor,
and money to better advantage. The doctrine of protection
as well as common humanity and common-sense orders the
gradual but steady wiping out of all duties on everything
necessary to the health and comfort of the people unless in a
reasonable time these duties can supply us better and cheaper
goods than we can buy in the world market. That time was
passed at least twenty years ago in wool, but Schedule K still
stands. It is supported by an interpretation of the formula
of protection, which, as one picks it out to-day, from the
explanations and practices of the wool-growers and wool
manufacturers, is only a battered wreck of its old self. It
ignores utterly the time limit, the “reasonable” period in
which an industry was to make good. It ignores the condition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>that the duty should not destroy fair competition.
Moreover, it stretches the function of the duty from that of
temporarily protecting the cost of production to one of
permanently insuring profits. The chief appeal of those
who employ this distorted notion is not to reason at all, but
to sympathy—sympathy for the American working-man.
Call their attention to the inequalities of the duties on raw
wool, and they will tell you of the difference in the labor cost
of dress goods here and in England. Tell them the quality
of our goods is deteriorating, and they will draw you a picture
of the blessings of the American working-man. Tell them that
the wool schedule has taken blankets and woollen garments
from the sufferers from tuberculosis, who certainly need them,
and they will tell you that “the American people are better
clothed than any other people in the world and their clothes
are better made.” The chief capital of the stand-pat protectionist
is some variation of this appeal. The hearings
preparatory to the Payne-Aldrich Bill were stuffed with them,
and they were used in reply to every conceivable argument.
For instance, the head of what is called the “file trust” was
on the stand. It had been shown that the gentleman was
selling files abroad much cheaper than at home, that he had
a practically prohibitive duty, one which had reduced imports
to about one per cent of the file consumption in the
United States. It was also certain from his testimony that
his laborers could not be getting a very large share of the duty.
“Do you not think,” the chairman asked him, “that if the
tariff is laid in the name of labor, labor ought to get the
tariff?” Here is the answer he received:</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>If you will pardon me for expressing one little thought, I
will say that I walked down this morning from the Willard, and
saw a pair of horses, a beautiful cart all equipped with fruit,
vegetables, and one thing and another. I can close my eyes and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>see that condition over on the continent of Europe, with barefooted
women in rags, with a few Newfoundland dogs, or some
other kind of dogs, hitched up with a string harness to the cart,
and a few vegetables, that they are pulling around.</i>”</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no reason to doubt that the gentleman saw on
Pennsylvania Avenue the prosperous cart he described.
There is no doubt he might have found on the continent of
Europe his “barefooted woman in rags.” But if he had
crossed over to the Washington market, he would have found
on its outskirts numbers of men and women, some of them
white-haired, who have brought in that morning from great
distances out of Washington on their backs or behind tottering
mules, pitiful handfuls of field flowers, wild roots, and perhaps
a bunch or two of garden stuff, quite as pathetic a
spectacle as the pathetic one with which he was trying to
befuddle the Ways and Means Committee. All over Europe
he will find as prosperous vegetable carts as those he saw in
Washington—all over the United States on the outskirts of
the cities he will find, if he will look, women picking up coal
and bits of wood along the tracks of railroads and in the yards
of factories, and see them carrying their pickings home on
their backs. The gentleman indeed will rarely enter or leave
an American city on a railroad that he will not see something
of this kind.</p>

<p class='c007'>Any one who has observed the life of the working-man on
both sides of the Atlantic knows that wages, conditions,
opportunities, are vastly superior as a whole in the United
States. It is a New World, with a New World’s hopes. But
it is only the blind and deaf who do not realize that the same
forces of allied greed and privilege which have made life so
hard for so many in the Old World are at work, seeking to
repeat here what they have done there. The favorite device
of those who are engaged in this attempt is picturing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>contrast between the most favored labor of the United States,
and the least favored of Europe. It is a device which “Pig
Iron” Kelley used throughout his career with utter disregard
of facts. Mr. McKinley followed him. In the course of his
defence of the tin plate duty he read, with that incredible
satisfaction which the prohibitive protectionist takes in the
thought that his policy may cripple the industry of another
nation, an English view of the effect the proposed duty
would have in Wales. “The great obstacle to tin plate
making on a large scale in the states,” said the article, “is
the entire absence of cheap female labor.” Mr. McKinley
paused and said impressively, “We do not have cheap female
labor here under the protective system, I thank God for that.”
And yet at that moment in the textile mills of New England,
of New York, and of Pennsylvania, not only were thousands
of women working ten, eleven, and more hours a day,
because their labor was cheap, but thousands of children
under twelve years of age were doing the same.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “American working-man” has long been the final argument
in every tariff defence, the last word which routed both
statistics and common-sense. This was Mr. Aldrich’s clincher
when he worked so hard in 1909 to continue or to increase
the duties of the Dingley Bill. “<i>Protective duties are levied
for the benefit of giving employment to the industries of Americans,
to our people in the United States and not to foreigners</i>,”
he said, and reiterated in a variety of ways. But take
Mr. Aldrich’s own tariff-made state and examine in detail
the experiences of its laborers. Rhode Island is one of the
most perfect object lessons in the effects of high tariffs in
this or any land. An object-lesson should not be overlarge.
It should be something you can see, can walk over if you will.
Rhode Island satisfies this condition perfectly. In the
matter of the protective tariff Rhode Island is the more useful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>as an object-lesson because she was a well-developed state
when the system was applied to her. She had at the beginning
of the nineteenth century flourishing farms and some
40,000 sheep. She was exporting annually between two and
three millions of agricultural products. She was building
many ships, and from her fine ports carrying on a varied and
lively trade with other lands. She was well advanced for
the time in manufacturing. Long before the Revolution,
Rhode Island’s iron foundries turned out cannon and firearms,
anchors and bells and all sorts of small wares. When the cotton
factory came—and she had the first in the country, the
Slater factory of Pawtucket, she was able to make her own
cotton machinery. In the manufacture of woollen cloth, she
took a prominent place from the start.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was then to an all-around development that our policy
of high protection was applied in this particular state. Under
its stimulus her manufactories have multiplied and enlarged
in a truly magnificent fashion. The story of this development
cannot be told here, but like all stories of rapid growth
it excites and dazzles. The results are sufficient for the
present purpose. In 1909 the manufacturing plants of Rhode
Island turned out goods worth $279,438,000—about $375
for each man, woman, and child in the state. But while she
has been making things to sell at this prodigious rate, she has
ceased entirely to build ships and send men to sea to trade.
That is, while high duties were stimulating mightily the making
of all that went into ships, they were making the ships
so costly to buy that nobody could afford them. Rhode
Island had her factories, and part of the price paid was her
ships—her ships and her farms, for her farms steadily and
surely went to pieces. To-day she has not over 4000 sheep,
one-tenth of what she raised fifty years ago. Between 1880
and 1900 the improved land decreased by 17 per cent. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>is practically dependent on the world outside for food. She
buys her apples on the Pacific coast, her flour in the Mississippi
Valley, and her meat from the Beef Trust.</p>

<p class='c007'>But what has the tariff to do with the neglect of the Rhode
Island farm? Everything. A farm is a family affair as no
other industry is. It yields its best only when it passes down
from generation to generation. Tenants, however faithful,
are not sufficient. It demands its own, and in Rhode Island
its own has deserted the farm for the factory. Quick fortunes
seemed to lie that way. It seemed to demand neither the
patience nor the drudgery; it was ready money at least, and
the young men and women left the farms to the old people,
and the old people died. Those who followed them were but
dregs of the old communities—the shiftless, the weak, the
ignorant, and the unambitious. The farm yearly dropped back
and it lies to-day a forlorn and unkempt relic of its old self.</p>

<p class='c007'>All Rhode Island then flocked to manufacturing, until
to-day the one thing in the state which sticks out above everything
else is the factory. It is the factory in which capital
is invested and from which dividends are drawn. It is the
factory which employs the population. It has been estimated
that three-fourths of the people are dependent upon
the textile mills alone. The great body of breadwinners in
Rhode Island not directly connected with the textile trades
is busy administering to the wants of the textile workers.
Further, that portion of the population which does not belong
to these industries is dependent upon other highly protected
industries: on rubber, with its duty of 35 per cent, on
machinery (45 per cent), on cheap jewellery (87 per cent), on
silver and gold wares (60 per cent). That is, Rhode Island
to-day is a tariff-made state, and as such should offer us ample
material for an easy analysis of what the American system of
protection, given full encouragement, does for a community.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>As we have seen, it concentrates effort on one line, putting
an end to agriculture and commerce. But this may not be
a bad thing. If a state grows richer by specialization, is it
not wiser to specialize? That of course depends upon how
generally the fruits of the process are distributed, how greatly
the condition of the mass is elevated, how much its happiness
and health are improved. In a tariff-made state as in another
the success of the system depends upon what the people at
large are getting out of it; that is, what does it do for the
American working-man? The first feature of the textile
industry in Rhode Island which strikes even a casual observer
is that the operatives are not Americans; they are distinctly
foreigners—new-come foreigners. Less than 16 per cent of
them, as a matter of fact, are born of what the industrial
authority of the state calls “United States fathers,” the other
85 per cent are in percentages decreasing in order of their
naming here: French Canadians, Irish, English, Italians,
Germans, Scotch, Portuguese, Poles, and Russians, besides
a considerable number classed under “other countries.” We
have the surprising fact then that, as far as the benefits of the
textile tariffs are concerned in Rhode Island, if the laborer
gets them, it is a foreign laborer.</p>

<p class='c007'>A second surprise awaits the student of these Rhode Island
laborers blessed by protection. They are an unstable quantity.
They must be constantly replaced. The “benefits”
do not hold them. The success of the overseer in the textile
factory has come to be judged largely by his ability to “hold
labor.” One of the interesting proofs of the restlessness of the
operatives is the small percentage of people in the state who
own their own homes. A recent careful investigation into
the housing conditions of the state shows that farm-houses
aside, 75 per cent of Rhode Island’s population live
in rented houses. That is, in one of the first settled states of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>the Union, one of the most advantageously situated, one
offering the best opportunities for diversified occupations,
one of the richest in its per capita product and bank deposits,
only a fourth of the people live in houses which they own.</p>

<p class='c007'>But why should the laborers in an industry which the people
of the United States pay so handsomely to support be restless?
Why in these seventy years and more of continued
and constantly increasing protection have they not
become a stable, settled, home-owning body of American
workmen? Surely that is what we have been taught to believe
the tariff would do. The answer to a question of this
nature is always complicated. Nevertheless, in this case it
is answered fairly well by a review of the conditions under
which the textile operative works, the wages he receives, and
the money he must expend to live.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under the most perfect conditions yet devised the making
of cotton and woollen cloth is hard and wearing labor. Under
the conditions too general in Rhode Island it is exhausting
and dangerous. The very atmosphere in which the work
goes on is against the operative. The temperature throughout
the factory runs high—80°, 90°, 100°, even, is not unusual.
The work does not require this; the factory laws
of England forbid the excessive temperature in which much
of Rhode Island’s spinning and weaving is done. Worse than
the high temperature is the degree of humidity which prevails.
Without a certain moisture in the air the “work does
not go well.” The result is a good deal of the time an atmosphere
as oppressive as that which Washington and Philadelphia
suffer in summer time. The ventilation in most of the
factories is insufficient, and as any draft is bad for the work
the windows are usually closed from end to end of the great
barracks. A half hour in the atmosphere of a factory is
sufficient to throw one unaccustomed to it into a steaming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>perspiration. The operative usually ends the day’s work in
wet clothes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then there is the cotton lint, or “fly,” as it is called, which
literally fills the air. It is no unusual thing to find the air
around the factory for a hundred or more feet literally alive
with cotton shreds. There are contrivances for carrying off
a certain amount of this dust, but there are few Rhode Island
factories which have installed them, and there is no one in
which, so far as I know, any energetic and scientific efforts
are making to solve the terrible problem. For terrible it is.
Breathe a cotton-saturated air, a damp, hot air at that, for
ten hours a day and consider the condition in which lungs
and throat will be.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now these are conditions natural to the making of cotton
and woollen cloths, conditions which can never be entirely
corrected. They are hard and wearing, but they become
dangerous in the extreme when combined with certain other
conditions not incident to the industry, due entirely to the
ignorance or the greed or the indifference of factory owners.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is hard to believe that men who ask other men and women
and children to labor ten hours a day in a dripping heat and
an atmosphere alive with cotton and wool particles will be
slow to furnish them abundant supplies of pure flowing
drinking water; but a bucket or barrel filled from some
outside source is frequently all that is furnished a floor of
workers.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is difficult to believe that factory owners would not be
eager to see that these workers of theirs were furnished with
comfortably heated toilet rooms, with every sanitary appliance;
but all up and down the Pawtucket River one finds
factories with toilets that cannot by any stretch of words be
called respectable.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the day’s work is done the textile operative rarely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>has a comfortable cloak or dressing room in which to prepare
for the street. If it were merely the matter of putting
on a hat and coat, this would not be serious. But part at
least of the clothes ought to be changed before going out.
The heat, moisture, and dust under which he has worked
for ten hours make it unsafe to go suddenly into the open air
without dry garments. In cold weather a chill or shock is
almost inevitable. But it is rare that the factory provides a
dressing room. The result is that bronchitis and pneumonia
are always attacking textile operatives, weakening lungs and
throat and fitting the system for the white plague, which
hangs like a perpetual shadow over a textile community.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now for fifty-eight hours of labor a week under these conditions
what do they earn? How well equipped are their
pockets to fight the exhaustion, the threatening diseases
which are incident to their labor? To avoid exaggeration
accept the figures for 1907, one of the occasional boom years
which cotton and woollen manufacturers have enjoyed in this
country. The average weekly earnings for 58 hours in cotton
factories in that year were: For the carding room $7.80, for
mule spinners $12.92, for speeders $10.62, for weavers $10.38.
In the woollen industry the picker received $8.00, the woman
spinner $7.25, the man spinner $12.91, the weavers $15.34.</p>

<p class='c007'>If a man could make these wages for fifty-two weeks a
year throughout his working life, if he had a thrifty wife and
healthy children, his lot, if not altogether rosy, would be far
from hopeless; he might even be able to realize the dream
of a little home and garden of his own which lurks in the mind
of every normal man, and which in the case of the textile
operative is almost imperative if he is to have a decent and
independent old age. For this man, however husky he may
be at the start, however skilful a laborer, has always a short
working life. There are few old men and women in textile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>factories. By 55 they are unfit for the labor. The terrible
strain on brain and nerve and muscle has so destroyed the
agility and power of attention necessary that they must give
up the factory, where, indeed, for several years their output
has probably been gradually decreasing. As almost all textile
operatives are paid by the piece the wage will gradually fall
off as dexterity declines. By 55, then, if not earlier, he drops
out, picking up thereafter any odd job he may.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is this short working life of the father, with the declining
wage for years before it actually ends, that makes child labor
an essential factor in the solving of the problem of the textile
family. Without the help of the child the father cannot
support the family and lay aside enough to insure his own and
his wife’s future. His wage, and the wear and tear he suffers,
make it impossible. The child must help.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the children prove healthy, if they “turn out well,” if
work is continuous, the little home may be secured and the
modest little dream may come true. But suppose that a
weaver, rushing into the cold air at the end of his ten-hour
day, is chilled and has pneumonia—it happens often enough.
Suppose an uncovered gear or belt catches him in an incautious
moment and crushes a limb or takes his scalp, or a carelessly
handled machine nips off a finger—it happens all the time.
Carelessness? More often it is that the limit of human endurance
has been passed. Fatigue has ceased to be normal and
has become abnormal—his mind is dulled—his nerve deadened—his
muscles do not respond. The wonder is that in
the shrieking, devilish uproar of the factory, a tired man can
keep up his habit of caution as steadily as most of them do.
Suppose that, standing through the hot summer in the poisoned
air of a dry closet, he falls ill of a fever. Or, if he
escapes all these things, suppose that the factory goes on short
time—thousands of operatives all over New England have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>had their weekly wages cut in half in the last three years by
short time. Or, suppose that, which has happened repeatedly
in Rhode Island, he is obliged by some intolerable condition
to strike and have no wage—what happens then? That
happens which is more disastrous to the family than even
child labor—the wife must go into the factory. So narrow is
the margin in the best of times that an illness, a shut down,
disturbs the budget so that only the combined exertion of all
the members of the family can save it. The mothers go into
the factory, and the homes gradually go to pieces. After
her ten hours at spindle or loom the woman hurries to a cold,
unkempt house, which she must make comfortable and cheerful
if it is to be so. Is it strange that the homes of the factory
mothers are generally untidy, the food poor, the children
neglected? How can it be otherwise? Her limit of endurance,
of ambition, of joy, even of desire of life, has been
passed. More appalling, she sees her ability to work falling
off. Almost universally, women who have worked ten years
in a factory have the patent-medicine habit—they are “so
tired” they “take something.” Is it surprising that a few of
them finally discover that they can get from beer or whiskey
the same temporary strength at less cost? The surprise is
not that many drink, but that more do not.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now the hope of this factory mother lies in her child, since
she, like her husband, is bound to wear out at a comparatively
early age. And what chance has she to bear a healthy child?
They give you heartbreaking figures of infant mortality in
Rhode Island, and everywhere one goes what one sees and
hears confirms their truthfulness. The district nurses talk
to you of “bottle babies,” the factory mother being, as a rule,
so poorly nourished and so overworked that she cannot nurse
her child. Moreover, she cannot care for it. She must
return as soon as possible to the factory. The doctor’s bill
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>is heavy. “He” is having a hard time, the mill is running
short. The baby is left to an older child if there be one, or,
if there is none, it perhaps goes to one of the human institutions
of the factory town—the “old woman.” The old
woman may not be over 50, but the factory has got all it can
out of her and the factory community utilizes her by giving
her its young children to care for, paying perhaps $2.00 a week.
The old woman may have borne children, but she has never
had an opportunity to learn to care for them properly. She
is often so deaf she cannot hear them cry and she is too poor
to buy them proper food, and to boot, she may be a tippler.
Unless husky beyond all probability, or saved by some lucky
chance—a district nurse or a sister or some other good
angel—the baby dies. One should go to the cemetery to
see how many die. There is nothing more pitiful in all this
beautiful world than the interminable rows of little graves in
the cemeteries of the factory towns.</p>

<p class='c007'>In recent years the problems of the operative have been
complicated by the soaring cost of living. Almost everything
he buys is higher in price, or if he insists on a standard
price, the article is poorer in quality. Take the very protected
articles from which Rhode Island draws her wealth.
All these 68,000 textile workers must have clothes. The
price of women’s all-wool dress goods increased in Providence,
the centre of the industry between 1891 and 1907, over 33 per
cent. There was an increase in practically all the cotton-warp
goods varying from 4 to 40 per cent. Underwear in
which there was any mixture of wool cost a fourth more in
1907 than sixteen years before. Cotton underwear was
reported as stationary in price, though since 1907 it has risen.
Bleached muslin used for shirtings was 34 per cent dearer in
1907 than in 1891. Cotton thread was 10 per cent dearer.
All linens were higher, though of course the textile operatives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>cannot buy much linen. That is, their own industries are
taking out of them the increase in wages which this same
period has seen!</p>

<p class='c007'>Are not the conditions so hastily sketched a fairly satisfactory
answer to the question with which we started out: Why
should not Rhode Island have a stable, settled, home-owning
body of American workmen? The hazards are so great, the
wage so low, the work so uncertain, that the American workman
or the foreigner, after a few years of experience here,
will not remain if he can get out. He realizes that the chances
are against the operative getting on in the world. What this
means is that <i>it is not he who is getting the benefits of the protective
duties which Mr. Aldrich says are laid for “our people
in the United States.”</i> He is barely getting a living, and getting
it under conditions which make life to himself, his wife,
and children a constant menace. The tax we pay on textiles
never gets beyond the stockholders, who in Rhode Island are
usually a family that for generations have run their mills
and absorbed the profits—absorbed them so quietly, too, that
one knows nothing of what they are save by the deceiving
outward signs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not only has the average factory owner absorbed the lion’s
share of the profits, but he set his face like a flint against
spending a cent of the protection he enjoys in humane efforts
to make the industry more tolerable. This man, who periodically
appears as a suppliant before Congress, praying for a
continuation of benefits which cost this whole people dearly,
will not, unless driven to it by law and outraged public opinion,
protect even the children who work in his mills. It
took the hard-fought labor wars of the ’80’s to force from the
legislature of the state (then as now held in the hollow of the
hands of men who live by the beneficence of this people) a
ten-hour law for children, a twelve-year age limit, and proper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>truant laws. But, the laws passed, no authorities were ever
found to enforce them, for the very sufficient reason that all
authorities in Rhode Island lived by permission of the mill
owners. A Bureau of Industrial Statistics for gathering
information and a factory inspector to report on the observance
of the laws which labor unions and social agencies had
forced from the legislature were finally secured. The first
set of inquiries sent out by the Industrial Bureau was treated
with contempt by the manufacturers, the Slater Club deciding
what questions it would and would not answer!</p>

<p class='c007'>According to the first of the reports issued only one corporation
in the state had its sinks properly trapped, and fever was
epidemic. The factories almost invariably were fire-traps,
wooden structures with low ceilings, no escapes, and often
with heavy wire screens <i>nailed</i> over the windows. The laws
governing child labor were generally ignored. And all this
was only about twenty years ago. Many improvements have
been made since then, but they have been made too often in
the face of the open or badly concealed opposition of the
average manufacturer, rarely with his sympathetic coöperation.
When men refuse coöperation with laws which concern
the health and happiness of those whose labor makes their
wealth possible, it is because of a stunted social sense. There
are other shocking proofs of this defective development in the
average Rhode Island textile manufacturer than his attitude
toward humane legislation. One of them is the housing of
operatives.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stories of foul, neglected tenements in Rhode Island factory
towns, drawn from recent investigation, could be multiplied.
They are another of the many good reasons why the textile
manufacturer finds it hard to hold labor together. They
are another of the many proofs of their unwillingness to pass
on to their working-men the protection granted in the name of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>labor. Take them to task for housing conditions and the
general attitude is one of indignation at what they call an
invasion of their individual freedom. Why should they build
houses for their operatives unless it pays to do so? Why
should they protect their operatives from grasping landlords?
And if the landlord can make more from a poor tenement
than a well kept one, whose business is it? It is <i>his</i> property.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again these mill owners practically take no responsibility
for accidents. They are insured against the claims the
injured may make. <i>All that they do is to render first aid.</i>
After that the man or woman must look after himself unless
fortunate enough to get free hospital treatment. If he gets
an indemnity, he must either settle with the insurance company
or go to court, where he is almost certain to fair badly.
For instance, here are cases taken at random from the records
for the September, 1905, session of the Providence County
Courts. One is of a girl, “incapable of speaking the language,”
who in 1901 lost a hand from unprotected gears and cog
wheels, five years later nonsuited with <i>costs to plaintiff</i>!</p>

<p class='c007'>Here is a boy <i>under</i> fourteen who after two weeks in a mill
was ordered to clean the iron cylinder of a carding machine
and lost his hand. Four years later he was awarded $1100
and $12.58 costs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here is a case of a young Polish girl new to the mills who
in cleaning a loom while it was in operation lost parts of two
fingers. She did not know it was unsafe or forbidden.
She saw others doing it. The court promptly gave the company
costs! One might go on for pages with these cruel
wrongs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The heartbreaking part of it is that it takes but a little
imagination, but a little knowledge, of what can and is being
done to ease hard industrial conditions in the world, and in a
scattered way in this very state, to show one how easily unselfishness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>could redeem Rhode Island. If the textile manufacturers
were, as a body, men of enlightened minds, if they
had caught even a glimpse of that vision of a new and nobler
industrial society which has convinced so many men and
women in this country not only of the brutality and wastefulness
of our present system, but of the entire practicability
of something better, they might easily make of their state as
perfect an example of what an industrial society should be as
it now is of what it should not be.</p>

<p class='c007'>This, then, is high protection’s most perfect work—a state
of a half million people turning out an annual product worth
$279,438,000, the laborers in the chief industry underpaid,
unstable, and bent with disease, the average employers rich,
self-satisfied, and as indifferent to social obligation as so many
robber barons. It is an industrial oligarchy made by a
nation’s beneficence under the mistaken notion that it was
working out a labor’s paradise. Not only is it a travesty of
the principles of protection, it is a mockery of that very individualism
behind which it takes refuge. Individualism does
not thrive at the expense of its fellows: it appreciates that
the very kernel of its own existence lies in respecting and
defending the rights of others. As for democracy, what
vestige of it is left in either the political or industrial machine
which controls the state of Rhode Island?</p>

<p class='c007'>Certainly the time has come when the pretence that high
duties “protect” the American working-man can deceive
nobody. The American working-man is not getting the duty.
He pays for his higher wages by his higher productivity. It
is an old and established law of industry drawn from the
experience of all nations that low wages mean high cost.
“The highest paid labor,” says Francis A. Walker, “is that
which costs the employer the least.” The cotton spinner in
India gets 20 pence a week—the cotton spinner in England
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>20 shillings, but English cottons flood India. The iron worker
in Russia gets 3 roubles a week, in England four or five times
as much, but it is the Englishman who supplies the markets
of Europe. The cotton labor of Egypt and India receives
not over one-tenth of what the Southern labor does, but it is
our cotton which supplies the world. The wheat hands of
the Eastern world are paid from a twentieth to a fifth of what
the laborers in the United States receive, but we export vast
quantities in competition with the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>The protectionist who answers every criticism of his rates
by conjuring a picture of “pauper labor” is equally conscienceless
in his attitude towards the relation of protection to
the two most disquieting industrial phenomena of our day, the
increase in the cost of living and the multiplicity of corporations
which aim to become and often are monopolies. For
instance, Mr. Whitman, whose forty years of garrulous and
successful defence of the present wool schedule has made him
the perfect type of the lay stand-patter, does not admit
that there is such a problem as the increased cost of living.
He speaks of it as “alleged.” According to Mr. Whitman, the
newspapers have talked so much about the subject that
people have been deluded into believing that the condition
is actual. If there is an increased cost in living, however,
the tariff has nothing to do with it. It is due to the cost of
the second-class mail! “I believe it to be absolutely true,”
says Mr. Whitman, “that the entire cost of publishing and
distributing the newspapers of the United States and the
magazines is one of the great contributory causes to the cost
of merchandise, and is borne by the consumer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Senator Lodge who, in his way, is as typical as Mr. Whitman,
denies that the tariff is materially related to this problem.
In 1910 Mr. Lodge was chairman of a Senate committee investigating
the cost of living. He did not go quite as far as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>Mr. Whitman—that is, he did not dismiss the subject by
declaring it merely a newspaper yarn. But he did find that
“the tariff was no material factor.” His chief reason for
this conclusion amounted to this: The increased cost of living
is world-wide. There are several causes, therefore the tariff
is not a material factor. It is much like saying that because
a log jam is made up of several logs no one log has anything
to do with the jam.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another curious bit of reasoning in Mr. Lodge’s report
was this: He had offered a list of 257 articles—almost all of
them protected to some extent—the prices of which he had
shown to have increased between 1900 and 1909 by 14.5 per
cent. Out of this list Mr. Lodge selected fourteen articles
on which the duty was highest. He found that the average
increase on these fourteen articles was only 13.1 per cent.
Therefore, he concluded, the tariff is no material factor in the
increased cost of living!</p>

<p class='c007'>Still another reason for exonerating the tariff from any guilt
in the matter was this: The increase of cost in all kinds of
farm products between 1900 and 1909 has been much greater
than the increase of manufactured products. Now, says
Mr. Lodge, there has been practically no change in the tariffs
on farm products in this period, therefore the tariff has nothing
to do with increased prices.</p>

<p class='c007'>This same quality of argument is used in regard to the trust.
There are several causes, therefore the tariff is not a cause.
The tariff contributed nothing to the foundation of the Standard
Oil Company, therefore it has had nothing to do with the
foundation of any other trust. Frequently the stand-patter
is so unfamiliar with his own formula, or so indifferent to it
that he will insist that the trust is an industrial surprise—a
species of highwaymen of whose presence on the road he
had no warning and for whose ravages he consequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>cannot be held accountable. If he knew his own formula,
or, knowing, was willing to regard it, he would be ashamed of
this sort of pleading. No evil concealed in the doctrine of
protection was ever more thoroughly advertised than monopoly.
At every stage, since Hamilton’s time, we have been
warned that it waited us just around the turn. For the last
twenty-five years, especially, we have seen it pour down upon
us,—an army whose ranks yearly grew thicker, stronger, and
more cruel. This is the very army which we have been cautioned
for decades to be waiting in ambush. There was
a counter force provided, of course, for this waiting enemy—domestic
competition. Now, we know what has happened to
domestic competition in the last thirty years in this country.
Freed from foreign competition—something which the
doctrine never intended should happen—the home manufacturers
have by a succession of guerilla campaigns, often as
ruthless and lawless as those of wild Indians or Spanish freebooters,
coralled industry after industry so completely that
they could control its output, and at once cheapen the quality
and increase the price.</p>

<p class='c007'>Any one who wants to know more than he already does of
the power and extent of industrial monopolies in this country
should read the vigorous report of Attorney-General Wickersham
presented to Congress in December, 1910. Consider
the relations to the vicious combinations Mr. Wickersham
enumerates, of the protection so many of them enjoy. Take
away the protection of the window-glass trust, and does any
one believe its high-handedness would not be gradually
checked? If the tobacco trust and sugar trust and paper
trust and powder trust and beef trust, all of which Mr. Wickersham
attacks for extortions and brigandage, had to meet
world competition, does anybody doubt that they would not
find many of their present methods impractical? Protection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>is so obvious an aid to them that it seems like insisting that
two and two make four even to refer to it. But put this up
to a stand-patter who knows his formula, and what do you
get? Why, the answer that protection was never intended
to foster trusts, and therefore it cannot be that it is doing so!
Protection, he will tell you, provides for domestic competition,
and, since it provides for it, his idea seems to be we must
have it! Whatever is in the formula is in practice! It is
no backwoods member from a remote Pennsylvania iron-and-steel
district who asserts this. It is the ablest man of them
all—Senator Aldrich himself. “I cannot conceive of such
a thing as a monopoly under protection” was the substance
of Senator Aldrich’s argument on the point in the last tariff
debate, as it had been for twenty-five years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Curiously enough, the same intellect which declares that
monopoly cannot exist under protection will under stress
argue: Take the duty from those who have formed trusts,
but give it to us who have not. “In order that you may?”
one feels like asking. This was a link in the argument of the
gentlemen who pleaded in 1909 that Schedules I and K (cotton
and wool) should remain undisturbed. There is no “cotton
trust”; therefore continue duties long unnecessary and wink
at those which trickery forces through! True, there is no
cotton trust—as yet. But how are trusts bred? Does our
experience show us a more fruitful father of them than cutting
off foreign competition, as the new duties on the higher grade
of cottons seem to have done?</p>

<p class='c007'>How are trusts bred? Is there any one left who does not
know that when such privileges as prohibitive tariffs are
dangled before men’s eyes they rush to seize them, build and
build again, regardless of all laws of trade? Is there any one
left who does not know that over-stimulated production pays
a penalty in half-time and shut-downs as truly as a man’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>intemperance pays one in physical and mental exhaustion?
And in the period of depression the new and weak fall into the
hands of the rich and long-established. This has been the
history of many a cotton factory. Why should it not all
end as it has in scores of other industries?</p>

<p class='c007'>But there are other breeders of trusts. What else are the
supposed agreements as to output and prices of which rumors
come from the great cotton organization, the Arkwright
Club? What else was the attempt of that club in 1909 to
unite with European cotton manufacturers to restrict the
consumption of cotton in order to lower its price?</p>

<p class='c007'>But should we expect that in an industry which boasts
so many men of great ability, daring, and ambition as cotton
manufacturing, and in which the rewards are so tremendous,
no man will ever be found strong enough to take advantage
of the tendencies to combination which already show themselves
and to work out a trust? Why should there not be
a Rockefeller or a Carnegie in cotton as well as in oil or steel?</p>

<p class='c007'>The woollen industry, like cotton, pleads to be allowed to
retain its high protection because it is still unshackled by
combination. That is partially but not entirely true. As a
matter of fact, there does exist a strong combination in this
industry—the American Woollen Company, which has
earned the popular title of “woollen trust” largely because of
its trust-like methods. The woollen trust is far from being
a monopoly, though it is certainly a good nucleus for one. It
already controls about one-third of our domestic production
of woollens and worsteds for men’s wear. Its annual product
is about $48,000,000. Its capital is $69,000,000. All
things considered, there seems to be no reason why eventually
the American Woollen Company, if it finds a Rockefeller or a
Carnegie, should not follow in the steps of steel and sugar
and oil and turpentine and bath tubs.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>Juggling the formula under which he pretends to work,
denying facts or shying from them, this is your typical stand-patter.
Press your attack on his position, however, and you
will find something more than negation. You will find an
angry, alert opponent, threatening in fact, if not in so many
words, to attack your position if you do not let him alone.
Threats have been the very essence of the power the unholy
wool alliance has had for so many decades, as Mr. Aldrich
more than once admitted in the making of the tariff of 1909.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>I say to the Senator</i> (Mr. Aldrich was addressing Senator
Dolliver) <i>that this wool and woollen schedule is the crucial
schedule in this bill ... if by insidious or any other means
he can induce the Senate to break down this schedule, that is the
end of protection, for the present anyway, in this country.</i>”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Aldrich was not defending the wool duties because
they were fair. He was defending them because they have
back of them the solidest vote in the Senate. Those to whom
he talked knew it, and they knew that he was warning them
that if they did not support these duties they could not expect
to get what they wanted, however just from the protectionist
standpoint that might be.</p>

<p class='c007'>There has always been a fraction of Mr. Aldrich’s party
in the Senate that could not be moved by threats—who if
they had known enough about the tariff on which they were
voting to realize that a threat was being held over them would
have resented it. It is that fraction which openly confesses
that they have “always voted as they were told.” The
<cite>Congressional Record</cite> is full of such admissions. Mr. Aldrich
could not sway them by appeals to their cupidity. He could,
however, by an appeal to their loyalty to the doctrine, to
their hatred of their political opponents. For years he has
silenced those who had qualms about a duty by a sneering
allusion to “Democratic talk.” “We heard all of that from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>Mr. Vest in 1890,” was his answer to Senator Dolliver’s
criticism of the wool schedule. When it came to revising the
duties on tin plate the stand-patters tried the same argument—“false
to protection.” The shame of it finally drew from
Senator Dolliver this outraged protest:</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>Is it possible</i>,” he said, “<i>that a man, because he voted for
the Allison tin-plate rate of 1889 and heard poor McKinley
dedicate the first tin-plate mill in America, can be convicted in
this Chamber of treachery to the protective tariff system, if he
desires that schedule reëxamined, after seeing the feeble enterprise
of 1890 grown within a single decade to the full measure of this
market-place, organized into great corporations, overcapitalized
into a speculative trust, and at length unloaded on the United
States Steel Company, with a rake-off to the promoters sufficient
to buy the Rock Island system? If a transaction like that has
made no impression upon the mind of Congress, I expose no
secret in saying that it has made a very profound impression on
the thought and purpose of the American people.</i>”</p>

<p class='c007'>In this outburst of Senator Dolliver we have the heart of the
insurgent revolt against stand-patism. In essence it is a
revolt against years of betrayal of the principles the stand-patters
were pretending to uphold, of solemn-faced defence
of things which are not so, of silencing critics by sneers and
threats. And for what? That those who support them by
votes and campaign donations may monopolize the great
industries of this land and pile increasing burdens on the backs
of its humble toilers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is it any wonder that as men understand the real meaning
of the system they declare, as did Senator Dolliver:</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>So far as I am concerned, I am through with it. I intend to
fight it.... I intend to fight without fear—I do not care what
may be my political fate. I have had a burdensome and toilsome
experience in public life now these twenty-five years. I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>beginning to feel the pressure of that burden. I do not propose
that the remaining years of my life, whether they be in public
affairs or in my private business, shall be given up to a dull consent
to the success of all these conspiracies, which do not hesitate
before our very eyes to use the law-making power of the United
States to multiply their own profits and to fill the market-places
with witnesses of their avarice and of their greed.</i>”</p>

<p class='c007'>But there is more than what Senator Dolliver, even, saw
wrapped up in the question of protection as we are applying it.
Deeper than the wrongs it is doing the poor, deeper than its
warping of the intellect, is the question of the morals which
underlie its operations. Simmered down to its final essence
the tariff question as it stands in this country to-day is a
question of national morals, a question of the kind of men
it is making.</p>

<p class='c007'>The happiness and stability of the peoples of this earth have
always been in strict accord with their morality—not a
morality made up of rules and traditions, of do’s and don’t’s,
but that living force which pervades the world of men like
an ether, the only atmosphere in which self-respect can
flourish, and in which the rights and happiness of the other
man are as sacred as your own. Emerson saw this force
everywhere, “like children, like grass”; yet, sadly enough,
“like children, like grass,” its essentiality is often ignored.
Men try to construct systems and work out plans in defiance
of it, only to see them destroyed; they try to live without it,
only to die. Activities that ask toll of our inner honor and
crowd our fellow-men, that do not contribute to the general
goodness and soundness of life and things, cannot endure.
Every practice, law, system of religion, government or society
must be finally sifted down to this: Are men better or worse
for it? What does it make for, in the main, callousness or
gentleness, greed or unselfishness? Are men because of it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>more eager for freedom of mind and joy of heart, or are they
more eager for gain and material comfort?</p>

<p class='c007'>The troubled face of to-day is chiefly due to the realization
that so much of our achievement does not stand the morality
test—does not make the right kind of men. Here is where
the trust fails. A Standard Oil Company violates a man’s
self-respect and outrages the rights of the other man. The
harsh judgment of the world is due to that. The gathering
into a few hands of what nature made for all, weakens equally
the sense of justice in the individual and limits the natural
freedom of his fellow, and doing so must cease. Here, too,
is the final case against the doctrine of protection. As we
know it, it operates in defiance, and often in contempt, of the
imperative moral demand that all human activities improve,
not injure, those concerned, that men be better, not worse,
for them. The history of protection in this country is one
long story of injured manhood. Tap it at any point, and you
find it encouraging the base human traits—greed, self-deception,
indifference to the claims of others. Take the
class chiefly involved in making a tariff bill—the suppliants
for protection. We have seen in previous chapters the ends
they seek, the methods they employ. What kind of men does
this make? It makes men deficient in self-respect, indifferent
to the dignity and inviolability of Congress, weak in self-reliance,
willing to bribe, barter, and juggle to secure their
ends. All this is on the face of the activities of men who run
their business through Congress.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is another moral angle of this matter which must be
faced. These men who tremble at the idea of unprotected
business, what kind of producers does it make of them?
<i>Quality is a moral issue.</i> A man’s handicraft is the final test
of his integrity: let it be slovenly and unfinished, let it be
showy but unsound, let it never get beyond a first stage of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>value, let it be turned to quantity, not value, and you have a
measure of the man’s character. Moreover, you have a
contaminating thing. People forced by conditions to use
dishonest goods, who find their shoes quickly falling to pieces,
their coats quickly threadbare, their food adulterated, their
rented rooms out of repair, who are forced to pay for things
without virtue, quickly lose all sense of quality. They never
give it because they never see it. Can an employee who
knows that his employer adulterates his fabrics and covers up
imperfections regardless of the interests of the consumers,
be expected to continue to care for the quality of his own
work? There is a universal outcry against the poor workmanship
the day laborer gives—the lack of interest in the
work—but can he be expected to care if his employer does
not? At the very basis of the laborer’s general indifference as
to whether he gives a full day of honest work or not lies a
widespread indifference among business men as to the quality
of the output of their factories and shops.</p>

<p class='c007'>If there were no other case to-day against protection, as we
apply it, it ought to fall in more than one industry, on the
deterioration of quality it has encouraged, in the ambition it
excites to turn out quantity, not give value. Moreover,
this vicious result hits the poor man. We can make as good
woollen textiles in the United States as are made anywhere
in the world; we do make many of them—at double the
price that they cost abroad; but cutting off all competition
in cheap goods as our tariff does, enables the domestic manufacturer
to ignore the quality of these goods as he could not
do if he were subjected to proper foreign competition. He
knows he can sell what he turns out. There are no other
goods for the poor man to buy; the cheaper he can make them
the better; they will have to be replenished the oftener, and
so trade will be encouraged! So flagrant has this offence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>against sound morals become in cloth manufacturing that in
the last two years there has developed an organized revolt
against it among manufacturers of clothing. And this
attack has been based by certain of them on the sound ground
that it is unethical.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is but a step from indifference to the quality of goods, to
indifference to the lot of those who make the goods. The
tariff is laid to help and protect the working-man. According
to the protectionist argument a tariff-made state like
Rhode Island, a tariff-made city like Pittsburg, should produce
the happiest, most prosperous, best conditioned working-men
and women in the country. We have seen something of
what the tariff has done in Rhode Island. In Pittsburg it
has worked contrasts between labor and capital still more
violent. It has produced on one hand an absentee landlord,
the “Pittsburg Millionnaire,” and on the other a laborer,
whose life as pictured by one of the most careful investigations
into living conditions ever made in this or any country,
the Pittsburg Survey, is made intolerable by a twelve-hour
day, Sunday work, cruel speeding, and cheerless and unsanitary
homes. This Pittsburg Survey is the most awful arraignment
of an American institution and its resulting class pronounced
since the days of slavery. It puts upon the Pittsburg
millionnaire the stamp of greed, stupidity, and heartless pride.
But what should we expect of him? He is the creature of a
special privilege which for years he has not needed. He has
fought for it because he fattened on it. He must have it for
labor. But look at him and look at his laborer and believe
him if you can.</p>

<p class='c007'>This, then, is the kind of man the protective system as we
practise it encourages: a man unwilling to take his chances
in a free world-struggle; a man whose sense of propriety and
loyalty has been so perverted that he is willing to treat the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>Congress of the United States as an adjunct to his business;
one who regards freedom of speech as a menace and the quality
of his product of less importance than the quantity; one whose
whole duty toward his working-man is covered by a pay
envelope. This man at every point is a contradiction to the
democratic ideal of manhood. The sturdy self-reliance, the
quick response to the ideals of free self-government, the unwillingness
to restrain the other man, to hamper his opportunity
or sap his resources, all of these fine things have gone
out of him. He is an unsound democratic product, a very
good type of the creature that privilege has always produced.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>But this man would be impossible were it not that he has the
backing of politicians and law-makers.</i> Behind and allied
with every successful high tariff group is a political group.
That is, under our operation of the protective doctrine we have
developed a politician who encourages the most dangerous
kind of citizenship a democracy can know—the panicky,
grasping, idealless kind. This is the most serious charge that
can be made against the man who holds or seeks office, that
he injures the quality of the citizen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man who is a candidate for Congress in any district,
city or country, has two courses open to him: He can appeal
to greed or to the ideal. He has the opportunity to discuss
with his constituents the questions and measures of his day
and to win them by the enthusiasm he awakens for ideals. He
has equally the opportunity to win them by the promises he
makes—the promises of individual local benefits, like pensions
and public buildings, or the promise of securing protection
for local industries. Take the case of “Pig Iron,”
Kelley—a man who clung to protection with the passionate
faith of a fanatic, who saw in it the great panacea for
the country’s poverty, who believed himself an incorruptible
man, and yet who allowed the protectionists of both parties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>in his own Philadelphia district to return him without effort
on his part, because they knew he would get for them what
they wanted. Mr. Kelley, honest man as he thought himself
to be, educated his constituents in the pernicious notion that
a Congressman’s first business is to look after their business.
The hopelessly sordid mental and moral attitude of Pennsylvania
toward politics is due chiefly to the training in selfishness
which for sixty years her Congressmen have given her.
Throughout this period those who sought her suffrage have
held up the promise of protecting taxes. Vote for us and we
will take care of you. One of the most immoral of the many
immoral trades which belong to the period of our Civil War
was the bargain the state made with the Republican party
to support the Union in return for the duties they wanted on
their manufactures. For years almost the sole appeal made
by candidates to the people of the state has been selfish.
They have had a steady education in the notion that government
is something from which to get a personal advantage.
Is it strange that the Pennsylvanian should come to regard
all public undertakings, even the building of a state capitol, as
legitimate prey? It is a logical enough chain from the
instructions of Thaddeus Stevens and “Pig Iron” Kelley to a
tariff-made Pittsburg, blind to the appalling inhumanity of
her mills, or to the shameless looting of a great state building.
Once the appeal to men’s greed is the established rule of a
state’s politics, the inevitable outcome is every degree and
species of baseness. On the other hand, a people trained by
its leaders to think of the general good, to consider principles
and ideals as of first importance to national life, to feel that
our fundamentals must be preserved before everything else—such
a people will rise to any height of enthusiasm and
sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c007'>The legislator who is so indifferent to the moral effect of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>his appeal on the country’s citizenship, who refuses to see the
connection between the appeal to selfishness and corruption
such as that which in 1884, 1892, and partially in 1910 swept the
Republican party from power, can hardly be expected to be
nice about the methods he employs to get the things he has
promised. Indeed, there is political necessity for just such
methods as have been discussed in the previous chapters of
this book. They are a part of the whole, perfectly consistent
with the appeal, not a whit more immoral. If Mr. Aldrich
promises the cotton manufacturers of New England to support
their demands, allowing them to raise the money and do the
work to reëlect him, can you expect him to do less than he
did in the Payne-Aldrich Bill—allow a tricky revision of the
cotton schedule to go through?</p>

<p class='c007'>Let us admit that reasonable people must not expect in
a popular government to arrive at results save by a series of
compromises. As long as men disagree as to what is desirable
to accomplish, as well as on the methods which are to be
employed in getting what they all agree to be desirable, each
successive step comes by one side agreeing to take less than
it believes should be given, and the other yielding more than
it believes wise. No reasonable person can expect the protective
system to be handled without compromises, backsets,
and errors of judgment, but <i>he can expect it to be handled as a
principle and not as a commodity</i>. The shock and disgust
come in the discovery that our tariffs are not good and bad
applications of the principles of protection, but that they are
good or bad bargains. Dip into the story of the tariff at any
point since the Civil War and you will find wholesale proofs
of this bargaining in duties; rates fixed with no more relation
to the doctrine of protection than they have to the law of
precession of the equinoxes. The actual work of carrying
out these bargains is of a nature that would revolt any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>legislator whose sensitiveness to the moral quality of his acts
has not been blunted—who had not entirely eliminated
ethical considerations from the business of fixing duties. And
this is what the high protectionist lawgiver has come to—a
complete repudiation of the idea that right and wrong are
involved in tariff bills. There is no man more dangerous,
in a position of power, than he who refuses to accept as a
working truth the idea that all a man does should make for
rightness and soundness, that even the fixing of a tariff rate
must be moral. But this is the man the doctrine of protection,
as we know it, produces, and therein lies the final case against
it,—men are worse, not better, for its practice.</p>

</div>

<p class='c027'><i>From the late Professor Goldwin Smith, Toronto, Canada</i></p>

<p class='c028'>“It is not only a most decisive confutation of the Protectionist fallacy,
but a rich repertory of illustrative facts. If anything can successfully contend
against the passion for the accumulation of wealth, entrenched as it
is in political power, Mr. Franklin Pierce’s reasoning, supported by his
array of the results of experience, will prevail.”</p>

<p class='c027'><i>From Miss Ida M. Tarbell, author of “The Tariff in Our Times”</i></p>

<p class='c028'>“It strikes me as being an unusually interesting and important presentation
of the subject. I have never seen a better comparative statement of
British and American shipping than your vivid chapter. I wish it could
be widely read.”</p>

<p class='c027'><i>From George A. Fuller, Master of the New York State Grange, Philadelphia,
N. Y.</i></p>

<p class='c028'>“I consider it the most useful contribution to the literature on the trust
question that has ever been published.... absolute fairness in dealing
with a question that few men have the ability to discuss without being influenced
in their judgment by the traditions and policies of their favorite
political party. He has given us a treatise ... which appeals to men’s
reason and common sense, regardless of their party affiliations. The chapter
entitled ‘A Talk with Farmers’ is unique in its force and simplicity,
and in the crushing force of its logic.”</p>

<p class='c027'><i>From David Starr Jordan, President of Leland Stanford University</i></p>

<p class='c028'>“... Admirable presentation of the question of tariffs and trusts. The
book is sound, wise, and timely.”</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
